1,"An excellent, authentic experience of such a friendly and happy island. We experienced the real side of Bali which would have been difficult without our excellent trip leader Wayan."
2,Wayan gave us an amazing tip in Bali. We got to experience the authentic Bali from a unique perspective. The places food and activities were all amazing. Truly an amazing holiday!
3,"Intrepid‚Äôs Beautiful Bali trip was the perfect intro to this magical island. From start to finish, everything felt so thoughtfully curated - from the peaceful home stay and delicious home-cooked meals to the incredible cultural experiences that took us off the beaten path (there‚Äôs so much more to Bali than the tourist traps). Walking through the rice fields with a local farmer while learning about Bali‚Äôs rich history was a highlight I‚Äôll never forget. Our host and driver were absolutely amazing - warm, knowledgeable, and full of heart & joy for their beautiful land. I truly felt like I got to see the soul of Bali, not just the sights. It also made me fall in love with the island, its people, and its traditions. If you want to experience this magical place in an authentic and deeply meaningful way, this is the way to do it!"
4,"Our leader Rona was indeed a highlight of this trip. We enjoyed Bali very much when traveling with him. The itinerary is a great mix, did great work on the homestay at Sibetan where we had a close local experience. Our group is amazing and dynamic and I had chances to share and listen to all stories from them."
5,Totally recommend this trip. Well thought out itinerary that included walking to the top of a volcano and snorkelling as well activities that helped learn about the culture here
6,"Excellent value, packed with experiences, sustainable approach to environment and people"
7,Book with intrepid. No regrets. Great people. Great guides.
8,"Wonderful trip! This was my first time to Bali and I couldn‚Äôt be more pleased with my experience! Everything was stress-free, and you learn a lot about this beautiful culture. Our tour guide Lena was wonderful, knowledgeable, and kind. Our driver Agung was great as well!"
9,"Intrepid offer ecologically friendly tours without ""shoving it down your throat"" or being martyrs about it. These very enjoyable and exciting guided tours offer a decent standard of accommodation, food, transport and help you ""get into"" what makes a country tick. You have all the fun and learn about the local culture, participating to bring economic benefit to the communities. A good time is had by all, knocking spots off the alternative of ""lying on a beach""...you see, do and learn so much - all in a laid back and utterly enjoyable manner. I absolutely loved my trip in Bali. Thank you Intrepid."
10,Just finished the Beautiful Bali trip and can definitely recommend it. A very good mix of activities. Our team leader I Gede Putra was outstanding and made the trip very memorable. Our driver was also brilliant. You could definitely feel safe with him .
11,"This trip was amazing! I felt like I got to see the real Bali by visiting smaller villages. The itenerary was perfect, nothing but good things to say about this trip!"
12,Beautiful Bali was a great trip to get away from the main touristy areas and explore more quieter local areas whilst having some physical activities thrown in to mix it up! I recommend this trip and everyone should at least sing 1 karaoke song at the local stay! Oohrah!
13,The Beautiful Bali itinerary is an amazing way to see the island outside of the typical tourist traps! Putra was an amazing guide and really made sure we had a great time! I highly recommend this trip to everyone!
14,Beautiful Bali was a wonderful trip that engaged local providers to empower them to provide insights into their own culture and lifestyles. It was a great mix of tradition and fun. This trip is part of a longer trip.
15,You can use any of my answers I‚Äôve already written - happy for any to be used
16,"Fin, sp√§nnande resa. Intressant program, om landets historia, kultur och livet. Mycket fin natur och vackra str√§nder. Fin avkoppling i kombination med sp√§nnande aktiviteter."
17,"Great experience! Well organised, fun and informative. A real insight into the lives and culture of the Balinese people. Our tour leader, Abraham, was awesome! üôèüôè"
18,"Beautiful Bali is a wonderful immersive experience with a small group activities ranging from volcano climbing, village walks, swimming in waterfalls, snorkelling, spending time with the locals at the home stays ‚Ä¶ just amazing"
19,"Truly amazing, will be hard to beat, such a beautiful country and beautiful people"
20,"The beautiful Bali tour is a must for anyone wanting to see the island. This tour has a great mix of jungle, towns, remote villages and beach and will suit all tastes. Just book it!"
21,"Their team was professional, friendly, and incredibly knowledgeable about Bali‚Äôs culture, history, and hidden gems. Our itinerary was perfectly balanced, giving us a mix of adventure, relaxation, and cultural exploration"
22,The trip was very memorable
23,"Our first intrepid trip was a brilliant experience, led by Wayan who was first class. We experienced so much local culture and very much enjoyed Beautiful Bali."
24,"I‚Äôve been to Bail before, and never really liked it. Getting out of the tourist areas and seeing the genuine Bali has completely changed my mind. I loved the country roads less traveled and the home stays and villages offered such lovely experiences. I feel blessed to have met and had our group led by Wayan, he‚Äôs an exceptional leader and so passionate about his island home. The mix of activities were well balanced and the itinerary was a good pace. This is a great introduction to Bali but also a great way too see what it really has to offer outside the malls and beach clubs of the south."
25,I learned more on this trip than any other country I‚Äôve visited. It‚Äôs my first trip like this after years of solo traveling and I can‚Äôt wait to do it again. Wayan was fabulous!
26,Excellent!
27,I already did
28,Beautiful Bali 9 day trip is filled with lot of activities to give a good taste about the nature and culture of Bali. It is bit hectic and should have one chill day given the trip is actually only 7 days not counting the arrival and departure days. If you are short on time and want to cover Bali quickly this may be a good trip for you.
29,I loved this trip! Perfect mix of outdoor adventure and exploring local communities! Totally away from touristy destinations and in the authentic Bali!
30,"An unforgettable Bali trip led by Putra! Highly recommend the Intrepid tour for its incredible experiences, from snorkeling in crystal-clear waters to an exhilarating volcano walk. Putra‚Äôs guidance made the adventure even more special. A must-do for anyone seeking an unforgettable Bali experience a little off the tourist path!"
31,"Excellent Trip incredible Team Leader! Komang made the trip memorable ! Only note to improve for me the rating of the trip in term of physical activity , it was a bit flat only real physical activities were the climb and the snorkelling . Love the trip out of the tourist route"
32,for the beautiful Bali tour you do not need to be in super physical condition. one activity includes 20km downhill by bike. another activity 2.5km uphill trekking and then 2.5km downhill. snorkeling for 1 hour is amazing. good accommodations. good food and contact with the population. consider that at night at the Balinese house you could have a shared bathroom with the owners.
33,"We spend a wonderful week with intrepid and our guide Spicy in Bali. A fantastic variety of activities, accommodation and sights, well organized and they took great care of everything, leaving us to relax and enjoy the trip."
34,A fantastic trip with great people. We got to see the real Bali away from mass tourism most of the time. Our tour guide Spicy was so good and made our trip perfect with his smile and his organisation. Shout out to our driver too! Hike up Mt Batur was AMAZING.
35,"Ethical, Efficient & Enriching. Plan less do more, Intrepid has it all."
36,"We had an absolutely amazing trip, lead by our guide Rona. Total immersion into an amazing country. I‚Äôd highly recommend trying Intrepid Tours"
37,"Beautiful Bali, was a fun, interesting adventure. Well planned & organised by intrepid. We had the most amazing tour leader YAN, he showed us the real Bali, the people, the villages and real life for the locals. Definitely add it to your to do list."
38,A great tour for sampling the best Bali has to offer in a short time
39,"Absolutely do this trip if you want to experience real Bali. You want to meet the locals, eat local cuisine, and have local, non-touristy experiences, then this is the trip for you. If you want to just sit on a beach and go shopping this is not the right one."
40,It is very like that we will participate in another Intrepid trip somewhere in the world. This Bali trip was so much better than if we had gone on our own.
41,Amazing trip
42,A perfect way to see Bali for the first time. A balanced mix of physical and cultural activities. Well programmed.
43,I appreciate Intrepid‚Äôs attempt to promote and maintain the culture of Bali.
44,"The Bali trip was a great first time experience with Intrepid. As a single female traveler, I felt safe with this tour and recommend Intrepid!"
45,"Just back from my first Intrepid trip and all I can say is that it was the best week of my life. 9 days in Bali travelling all over the island and getting to meet so many incredible people was such an amazing experience. Our group of 12 got on famously and our guide Wayan did an amazing job of teaching us all about the island, it's people and culture. I had so many ""firsts"" on this trip that the memories will stay with me forever. I cannot wait to book my next trip!"
46,"This was an excellent trip with a great guide and other likeminded travelers. I laughed and smiled so much on this trip. Loved seeing Bali and leaning about its culture and traditions. The bike riding, hike to Mount Batur before sunrise, and the snorkeling were my favorite activities!"
47,Absolutely amazing and highly recommend fun and such a beautiful place to explore. I felt safe with the group and supported throughout my trip!
48,"A well organised tour , with numerous inclusive activities . With a great guide in Yan , with his enthusiasm, knowledge and energy."
49,Trip was executed as advertised. I would recommend this trip for anyone looking for a immersion into the Bali nation and it‚Äôs people.
50,"A great amazing trips, lots learned in such a short time. An unforgettable experience!"
51,"Another Intrepid trip that I‚Äôd happily do again. As always, our leader was wonderful. Thank you Yan for the laughs, passion, and knowledge. I won‚Äôt forget it! I learnt so much about every place I went to, while travelling to places I‚Äôd never have thought to go to, and doing things I‚Äôd never have thought to try!"
52,"Another Excellent trip, this time to Bali. Everything about this trip was great, from my fellow Intrepid travellers, trip leader, hotels, food, sights & activities. You wont be disappointed!"
53,Be aware that Bali is a very dirty Island on Land and sea. If your leader is good you can learn a lot about Bali.
54,Excellent introduction to Bali. Trip was packed with fun activities which gave us a good Insite to Balinese lifestyle. Highly recommended.
55,A wonderful adventure with great activities . Very well organised .
56,"Fantastic trip, which I would recommend a great insight of Bali and a great adventure. I do feel that accommodation could be of a better standard as this was very poor."
57,"Brilliant trip. Our group leader Wayan Sudiartha elevated our experience with his support and enthusiasm, and I couldn‚Äôt have had a better trip overall."
58,"Wonderful trip that I highly recommend. The tour leader was amazing (Abraham), the accommodations were (on the majority of the cases) excellent and the activities were also great. Highly recommended trip!"
59,"Running out of time at the airport, so will submit it later."
60,"I went on a 9 day Intrepid Bali trip. "" Beauitiful Bali"" It was a fantastic experience. The trip was balance with alot of cutural experiences, lots of great activities, but with enough down time for yourself to go and explore the Bali streets, restaraunts and just time to soak in the Bali Island vibes. Our guild Andy, was excellent, knowledgeable, friendly and well organised. Which made our trip run smoothly and hassel free and relaxing. The accommodation was basic, but clean and very traditional, which added to the whole Bali old world feel that I remembered from 20 years ago. So if you a looking for a well organised, informative, relaxing and calm experience, I think this little nine day break in perfect. I would highly reccommend."
61,"I really enjoyed the variety on this tour and the local experience offered. I'm not really one for staying at 5 star resorts and drinking cocktails by the pool and then flying home, so this itinerary suited my travel expectations. I enjoyed the level of physical activity and varied experiences offered, as well as getting to travel to more rural villages and learn the local life. I really enjoyed the local cuisine and warmth and hospitality from the Balinese people."
62,"This was the trip of my life in regards to new things, awesome adventures and new experiences like seeing monkeys and climbing an active volcano. So if you like the adventure this is for you. Just be prepared to be on the road for 4-8 hours every other day, by train or bus, hotels comfort ok but minimal at times, noisy and jammed packed environments most times, super hot and humid weather, scared internet and out of comfort zone a lot. I'm 59 years old, female and maybe this has something to do with my comments about comfort level but it's doable for all age groups. You are going to have an awesome experience!"
63,"I would highly recommend Beautiful Bali for anyone who wants to experience true Balinese culture. Our group leader, Srix, was phenomenal! Her knowledge, leadership, and kindness was second to none. Though this is a group tour, as a solo traveller, I felt that I was in good hands with Intrepid Travel."
64,"Amazing trip, got to see all of Bali and learn about its culture."
65,I 100% recommend Intrepid Tours. Our guide was beyond amazing. We experienced the real Bali and its culture
66,"Best holiday I've ever been on, bar none! This was my first Intrepid tour and first solo trip so far from home. As a female traveller I always felt so safe. We also covered so much of Bali and had so many fun activities like snorkelling, hiking and white water rafting. The highlight of the trip though was the guide. She was so fun, enthusiastic and gave us so much information about the local culture and ways of life. She made the trip so special. I'm already planning my next one!"
67,"Whilst initially nervous about ‚Äúgroup‚Äù tours, my experience with Endeavour was excellent. Saw the real Bali, beautiful and calm and would recommend them to other travellers. Excellent organisation and great guides"
68,"This trip to Bali doesn‚Äôt disappoint! If you‚Äôre looking for an adventure, from climbing mountains to snorkelling with a multitude of colourful fish, this is such a wonderful snapshot of Bali beyond the overly popular destinations enjoyed by the majority of travellers. Definitely worth a visit if you want to go off the beaten track!"
69,Andy was a fantastic guide. We learnt a lot and the tour was great. I can recommend it to anyone.
70,"This was the first Intrepid trip I have ever been on and it did not disappoint. Rather than visit the tourist parts of Bali, I learned so much from the local people and their beautiful way of life. Our guide, Yan, was the most positive, caring and informative guide and we were so lucky to have him lead us. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!"
71,Beautiful Bali was my first solo trip and it certainly didn‚Äôt disappoint!!! Our guide Yan was outstanding and I met the best people while learning so much about Bali! Trip of a lifetime for sure!!!!
72,"Bali Beautiful with Intrepid was an amazing trip! We experienced lush greenery, vibrant culture, majestic waterfalls, delicious local foods, and shared love and laughter with our group and our fantastic leader, Yan. Thanks for providing such an opportunity!"
73,Excellent guide Excellent destinations within Bali Great evening restaurants chosen by our guide
74,"Wonderful trip which gave a good overview of Bali‚Äôs natural beauty from rice paddies, the mountains, the sea and its people. It was good cultural insight into Bali and perfect itinerary for the trip length, with a good balance of organised activity and free time to explore or relax. Would recommend."
75,"This trip has been fantastic, the sights, the food and the friendly people, I will definitely come back here."
76,Bali was just amazing. Our guide Putru had great knowledge of the areas visited and gave us great recommendations for restaurants when teh evening meal was not included. A gret experience! Thank you Intrepid!
77,Excellent guide Excellent destinations within Bali Great evening restaurants chosen by our guide
78,Fantastic trip. Putra was an awesome guide. Beautiful Bali did not disappoint and the home stay was a highlight and point of difference. Good mix of activity and time to explore.
79,Amazing trip. Very good value for money. Wonderful caring and knowledgeable guide. Great opportunity to meet people from all walks of life. Diverse and interesting experiences along the way that give a great sense of Balinese culture and values. Perfect balance between active and relaxing activities.
80,If you want to experience the not so often visited Bali with a group of strangers who become your ‚Äútribe‚Äù and a local guide who looks after after you and gives insight into Balinese culture then Beautiful Bali Intrepid is for you.
81,"Fantastic trip with a great mix of activities and downtime. Amazing interaction with local people and customs. Allan was an awesome tour leader, he made the tour very welcoming and enjoyable."
82,Beautiful Bali was amazing! A real look into the culture of Bali outside of the touristy spots
83,"Fantastic trip, loved every minute of it. Thanks to Putra, our guide, for showing us and bringing us on one of the best holidays of my life"
84,This was my first trip with intrepid and I have nothing but great things to say about it. Rona our guide leader for our trip was absolutely amazing. Very knowledgeable and clearly dedicated to ensuring we enjoyed every part of our trip to the fullest. I recommend this trip and Rona as your guide. Beautiful Bali definitely describes this adventure. Very cool way to see a lot of what the Balinese culture is all about.
85,"We had an absolutley awesome time on our Beautiful Bali trip. It was wonderful to be immersed in the culture, traveling to small villages and interacting with the locals, getting to experience the 'real Bali'. Some of the highlights were climbing Mt Batur, snorkeling and cycling through the villages. Our guide Wayan was so incredible. When my husband had an incident, requiring medical help, Wayan was so caring and supportive. Highly recommend!"
86,"With the Beautiful Bali round trip, you don't experience the beauty of Bali from a social media tourist perspective, but get to know the ""real"" Bali and its locals. The homestay in particular, which took a little courage on my part, gave me a realistic insight into life in Bali. I highly recommend this tour to anyone who wants to get a genuine picture of this beautiful destination."
87,"The Beautiful Bali trip was an amazing experience, providing a high level of cultural activities, along with physical and spiritual events."
88,Perfect organised trips to branch out in a group or by yourself.
89,This trip showed us Bali that we could never have seen on our own and brougt together a fantastic group of fellow travellers.
90,"I really enjoyed this trip around Bali, it was an amazing group and we got to see and experience well beyond the tourist areas."
91,Putra took really great care of me when I sprained my ankle during the hike. He kept checking in on me and made sure I was ok. He also made me feel included in the group as one of only 2 solo travellers in the group. He did an excellent job communicating the itinerary with his group. He is a wonderful leader. Our driver was also excellent. I really enjoyed this trip and the amazing people I met.
92,"An unforgettable trip discovering Bali's hidden gems, being immersed in the culture and getting to know the locals and their way of life - all in the company of a great group of new friends and with a fantastic guide! Can't recommend enough!"
93,"The trip was amazing, such a great group of people and our leader ‚Äòspicy‚Äô was wonderful!! Highly recommend to anyone hoping to see the authentic Bali with a bit of adventure, culture and relaxation! The best."
94,"Amazing trip, you get to see the side of Bali that you wouldn't necessarily see if you traveled solo. Great variety of destination and activities, really pleased with everything from Spicy's organisation and enthusiasm, the quality of hotels/transport and of course a great group!"

96,"The trip was amazing, such a great group of people and our leader ‚Äòspicy‚Äô was wonderful!! Highly recommend to anyone hoping to see the authentic Bali with a bit of adventure, culture and relaxation! The best."
97,"‚ÄúBeautiful Bali‚Äù was all that we had hoped for‚Äî great company, beautiful vistas, meaningful cultural experiences, and delicious local food (as a vegan, I was delighted with the food options across Bali). The yoga and spa treatments were tremendous and quite inexpensive. But it was our amazing leader, Yan, who epitomized this wonderful trip. Yan is warm, welcoming, funny, and ever-knowledgeable!"
98,"A truly unique glimpse into Balinese life. We were lucky to get Yan as our trip leader, and he showed us Balinese culture and lifestyle in a way that would‚Äôve been impossible without him. Intrepid lifted the veil on local culture, introducing us to locals who invited us into their homes and villages to share stories, knowledge and their delicious cuisine. Snorkelling, the Kecak dance and the Mt Batur hike were highlights, but so were the many swimming and socialising opportunities with the group. Excellent."
99,Beautiful Bali was such a lovely experience where we were fully immersed in the beautiful culture and we had a lot of contact with the locals. The presence of a local guide at different destinations was great. I don't think I would have encountered such beautiful experiences in the Balinese culture with the locals had I visited Bali alone. I highly recommend :)
100,It was my first experience using intrepid but definitely won‚Äôt be my last! I had an amazing trip and got to see so much more of Bali than what I would have if I went on a ‚Äòtypical‚Äô holiday. Going as a solo traveller was intimidating at first but as soon as I met the group and our local guide Andy I felt instantly comfortable. I feel I have made life long friends on this trip and will definitely be booking my next one soon!
101,"The experience from start to finish was seamless. The trip created lasting memories, exceptional experiences and the start of great friendships!"
102,"Fantastic guide, great knowledge, some amazing excursions and trips, I just hope the bathrobe dinner becomes a standard!"
103,Fantastic trip with so many inclusions. Andy was a kind caring leader who looked after us all.
104,"So well organised, Bali is beautiful, leader was outstanding, would encourage anyone to come in this trip"
105,"So well organised, Bali is beautiful, leader was outstanding, would encourage anyone to come in this trip"
106,One of the best things I‚Äôve done in my life! I‚Äôve seen so much of Bali I thought I‚Äôd never see and got an understanding of the local culture- 100% recommend
107,"This trip surpassed my expectations, if your looking to dive into Balinese culture this is the perfect trip for you"
108,"Never did I think I would feel so relaxed on such an active holiday...all thanks to amazing guide and fun packed itinerary. We really were shown so much of the island, its people, and culture. Highly recommend and can't wait to book our next Intrepid holiday."
109,An excellent trip with many interesting experiences and challenging activities. A must do adventure.
110,"Within 9 days you get to see Bali in a way you just can't organise by yourself, and if Wayan is your local guide you're in for one of the best holidays of your life. Bali has mass tourism and plastic polution, but we managed to get away from that."
111,Excellent leader. Interesting and challenging wide ranging activities for people of all ages
112,"One of the most beautiful trips I‚Äôve ever taken, travelled solo for the first time and it was incredible to make so many new friends in such a beautiful country"
113,"This tour was incredibly efficient and well organized - well executed by our guide, Putra. No standing around waiting for things- all hotels were ready when we arrived and all local guides were on time and ready to go. I appreciated the small group size too. It allowed us to get to know Bali in a way a massive tour group wouldn‚Äôt allow, which I appreciated extra as a solo traveler who found the idea of wandering around Bali by myself a little intimidating. Putra was attentive to all of our needs and I sure appreciated all of the water bottles he filled for us! Definitely recommend this tour!"
114,"This was my first intrepid trip & I am so glad I did it. I had the most magical experience with 11 other people plus our guide, Yan & our driver. I cannot recommend intrepid highly enough & what I truly love is the commitment to support local communities, which Yan cared about so deeply as well. Book the trip. Do it. Your life will only be enriched for the better!"

116,"A fantastic trip which shows you the true colours of Bali away from the tourist areas. Immersion into local culture is the key theme and you get to meet some fantastic people. Climbing Mt Batur, Snorkeling on Menjangan Island and visiting local villages are the definite highlights. A great mix of people and ages from 20-60 on a small, inclusive tours is fantastic. Highly recommended."
117,"Amazing trip round Bali, you go into the depths of how a real balinese live and the itinerary is really amazing and felt safe throughout the trip."
118,"This trip is amazing, definitely 5 stars! I really enjoyed all of the accomidation, meals, included activities, transportation and my group! We all got along really well. I would recommend this trip to anyone as it's so much fun for any age. Some highlights were climbing mt batur, snorkeling, staying with a local family, and included dinner in Lovina. What a great experience. Thank you Spicy for being such a great tour leader!"
119,Solo traveller - male 32 - it was great fun and lots of insight to the local culture. Good group and tour guide was brilliant. I had a lot of fun each day and laughed - I would recommend book ending solo travelling with the trip.
120,"Beautiful Bali lives up to its name in every way. A wonderful insight into Bali and its culture, well off the tourist track. If you want to have a true cultural experience of Bali, this is the trip for you."
121,"This trip was a good mix of local culture, fun and interesting activities and diverse experiences. I found the activity level great and really enjoyed the places we visited. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is active and wants to get experience a culturally insightful journey with built in fun!"
122,"Book this trip! It‚Äôs a fantastic balance between the tourism attractions you want to see as well as discovering Bali on a deeper level. The trip was well organized, the accommodations were gorgeous and the group size is ideal. This trip exposes you to the traditions, values and culture of Bali, it‚Äôs incredible!"
123,"Cannot recommend this trip enough to gain knowledge of Bali, its culture, people and places. Well organised trip and really into the real Bali. If you are lucky enough to get Komang as your guide you‚Äôve hit the jackpot."
124,"Wow! A trip of a lifetime! I booked this trip as a solo traveler, never having heard of intrepid, and I can‚Äôt be more grateful that I did! The itinerary, group, tour guide, and travel ethics are 10/10. You truly get to immerse yourself in a local experience and visit the top sites of Bali! Can‚Äôt wait to book my next trip!"
125,"Having done the old School public transport 18-35 intrepid 30+ years ago and now the more civilised I can say I recommend both options. Whether like me your a seasoned traveller or not, you will get a lot out of these tours"
126,I throughly enjoyed my recent Intrepid Tour. I last travelled with Intrepid 30 years ago and this time was just as amazing us then. Intrepid really show you the real side of a country and how people live within it. I would highly recommend it to curious and adventurous people wanting to get off the beaten track and have a local adventure. Thanks Intrepid.
127,"The Beautiful Bali trip was an amazing trip. Daily activities were well balanced with free time/rest periods. It exposed the heart of Bali‚Äôs tradition and culture. Palguna our tour guide coordinated our trip well, was attentive, knowledgeable, funny and a heartfelt advocate for Bali. I would definitely recommend Intrepid travel. This trip was a great introduction to the authentic Bali."
128,"Fantastic trip, great value for money and a local guide with a passion and enthusiasm for sharing their culture. Went as a solo traveller and never felt lonely in the tour. An awesome group and an awesome place!"
129,"Bali was never on my list of holiday destinations after all, most Australians have been to Bali too (like the Redgum song if you're old enough to remember?). I absolutely loved this trip! The tour has the right combination of adventure and relaxation, and a fantastic cultural experience! I highly recommend this tour to anyone such as myself that has never been to Bali!"
130,Real immersion into Bali. More than the beaches and sun. This trip gave a true experience into history of Bali local life and cultures. Stunning views and beautiful people. A truly thought out itinerary with a great tour leader. Highly recommend.
131,Amazing trip!! Saw and experienced Lombok and Bali as close to ‚Äúlocal‚Äù as possible. Enjoyed ourselves and learnt a lot and met people wit similar interests.
132,Beautiful Bali highlight it is so much more than resorts. Great trip!
133,"Another wonderful trip with Intrepid. Even though Bali is small, the Beautiful Bali trip incorporated such diverse content over the week. Really.enjoyed no having long bus days, ideal for someone who would like a short but impressive tour."
134,"The Beautiful Bali Tour gives you so much more than a holiday! Experience local village life and traditions, stay with a family, climb a mountain, snorkel in amazing coral reef with vibrant fish, in nine days you will come away touched by this island and its people."
135,The Beautiful Bali tour exceeded my expectations! And Wayan was the best guide - he truly made the trip all the better!
136,"Highly enjoyable, informative and well thought out insight into discovering Bali, it's people and culture. Very knowledgeable guide and a fantastic small group experience."

138,"A fantastic trip to discover the real Bali. We met such a lot of local people who shared their lives and knowledge with us. The trip was extremely well organised with the most amazing guide, Yan."
139,"Get inside the real Bali with this trip that combines beach, mountains, activities and trip that bring the culture to life and let you meet Balinese people away from the tourist trail."
140,Intrepid is an excellent travel agency for it's awareness of local business and environmental development of the country.
141,I highly recommend the Beautiful Bali trip! You get to see and experience do much with a wide range of destinations and activities. A highlight was how much we were able to interact with local families off the beaten path of the typical tourist spots. This was the best trip I‚Äôve ever been on and can‚Äôt wait to book my next intrepid trip!
142,The tour turned out beyond my expectations since I was a little skeptical at first joining a group tour. The itinerary was well planned and balanced. We had activities that helped us burn a few calories and rewards with laziness around the pool afterwards.
143,"Beautiful Bali was incredible. An amazing mix of the popular tourist spots and the remote places you‚Äôd never find alone. The trip was jam packed, so whilst tiring, it was so rewarding and I would not have wanted it any other way. Couldn‚Äôt recommend this trip enough!"
144,"The Beautiful Bali trip was one of the best experiences I‚Äôve ever had. Great opportunity to experience maybe some of the lesser known parts of Bali to get a true sense of island life while still getting to experience the busier touristy areas. The perfect balance for the trip. The itinerary is practically perfect, some active days, lots of amazing food, beautiful hotels and pools, and the friendliest people. The home stay experience was amazing, the houses were simple but incredibly welcoming and the community was the most amazing hosts. Snorkelling was amazing in Lovina and we saw turtles.

149,"This was my first adventure as a solo traveller and Intrepid was well priced and covered all the bases from immersing you into the culture and history, to including some fun party time too. Best adventure I‚Äôve had and Tini our guide comes highly recommended."
150,"An amazing trip I‚Äôll remember forever, mostly thanks to our amazing leader Tini. There was such a range of activities, including some nice surprises not included in the itinerary, and a good amount of free time. You definitely get to see Bali in a unique and special way. I‚Äôd recommend asking Intrepid about other people in your group - I was a solo traveller and I don‚Äôt think I would have enjoyed it as much if it was all couples/families."
151,I can‚Äôt begin to explain how amazing the trip with our tour guide Tini was! She made it a trip of a lifetime and I would recommend to anyone. I loved all of the activities which I never would‚Äôve done solo and met some wonderful people.
152,Our tour guide was fantastic - Tini is an asset to Intrepid. The rest of my group was lovely and our itinerary was well thought through.
153,"Great stays, great programs, great people, great places, great food. It is a must! Tini is an absolute gem! Thanks for everything!"

162,"This was my first trip with a tour group and Intrepid. Truthfully, I never thought of myself as a tour person. My friend suggested it and I went along for her. Wow did my mind change. The experiences I had and people I met were beyond my expectations. I was actually teary-eyed leaving our homestay. Sari, our homestay host, is a women that I will fondly remember my entire life. Our tour leader Putra was the best. I couldn't be happier!"
163,"The Beautiful Bali trip with Intrepid was an unforgettable experience. Our guide, Tini, was exceptional‚Äîher knowledge, compassion, and commitment to responsible tourism made the journey even more special.

165,A well-balanced itinerary to see Bali within a week.
166,Great way to see the real Bali away from the busyness of Canggu. The Balinese people are so warm and gentle and getting to more remote areas was a great way to see what a great place Bali is and that it‚Äôs so much more than beach clubs and luxury hotels. Had a great time exploring more off the beaten track.
167,I enjoyed the company of an exceptional group of people across a wide age range. This trip included fabulous activities with just the right amount of free time. We enjoyed great accommodation and excellent transportation. A popular Bali trip and it‚Äôs easy to see why
168,"Fabulous varied trip, providing a great balance of physical and cultural experiences around most of Bali, made all the better by our excellent guide, Wayan. He really cared about our experience and our group became part of the Bali Family! Suksema Wayan!"
169,"The beautiful Bali trip was an incredible, authentic and memorable experience. Being taken to many different inland destinations was a real privilege and I loved immersing myself into, experiencing and learning about Balinese culture. There are almost too many highlights to mention, but the Mt Batur view was incredible, and the optional white water rafting and cooking classes were fantastic. I also loved the Kecak dance performance with the vocal chanting. An excellent balance of activities and free time led by an outstanding group leader and other helpers."
170,"An exception way to experience the beauty of Bali and the Balienese culture. I wish I had discovered Intrepid sooner, but I will be back for more!"
171,"This tour was fantastic! Our leader Wayan was very organized and knowledgeable. I liked how we went to places in Bali I would've otherwise not gone to, more non-touristy places. Only downside was the bus was very squishy with 12 people but other than that I highly recommend doing the beautiful Bali tour!"
172,"This delightful trip around Bali visiting the island proper, was opportunity to see things out of the touristy beach settings. I learnt a lot about the culture and religious practices of the wonderful people on the island. The amount of activities on each day was well structured so it was not too tiring, and just enough! I really would recommend this tour. It was fabulous, and our guide (Wayan) was great!"
173,"Great trip! Loved the itinerary, I had an amazing time. Would definitely recommend it to anyone - also great for female solo travelers."

175,"BEST TRIP EVER!!! it was so amazing i canceled my flight home to stay longer üòÖ the tours, accommodations, food, people, EVERYTHING WAS AMAZINGGGG!!!"
176,What can i say about the Beautiful Bali tour? It was absolutely amazing from start to finish. Out guide Wira was very knowledgeable and passionate about Bali and this showed through making everyone passionate about the most beautiful place. This trip is a MUST! There is nothing like seeing the sunrise on the top of Mount Batur and that sight will always remind me of Bali and what a truly beautiful place it is.
177,"Amazing experience of the real Bali, combining learning about the culture, being in Nature, spending time with the locals and relaxing by the pool!"
178,"This was my first Intrepid trip and I was travelling solo but was far from alone! Any nerves I had going in were soon dispersed by the lovely group dynamic which was fun, kind, and inclusive. Our tour leader, Srix, was an absolute star and I know we will all think of her fondly when we reflect on our wonderful time in Bali under her care! Don't hesitate - book this trip."
179,"An excellent trip to give you a flavour of the real Bali, it's people and religion. Packed full of activities for your physical and mental wellbeing. Our fabulous tour leader, Srix made the trip with her friendliness, great organisation, passion and enthusiasm."
180,"Loved this trip and our engaging guide, Guna. So much more top Bali than meets the eyes, thank you!"
181,"If you are keen for an insight into Balinese culture/religion/everyday life, great food, a variety of (slightly energetic) activities, in a friendly, tropical destination - do this trip! A perfect way to escape Aussie winter for a week and de-frost in the sunshine too."
182,"This trip is jam-packed with interesting experiences. Highlights were the mountain climb and the sea turtle we saw while snorkelling. I met interesting people: both locals and fellow group members. Our guide Guna was professional, had a genuine caring nature and great sense of humour. I always felt safe on this trip and felt my curiosity and self esteem growing by the day. And the food was wonderful."
183,Beautiful Bali has the perfect combination of activity time/ variety and moving around to see different parts of Bali. Traveling with Intrepid opens up opportunities to get off the main tourist trail at times while still experiencing what has made Bali so popular. The people in Bali are all amazing and friendly!
184,"Loved this trip and our engaging guide, Guna. So much more top Bali than meets the eyes, thank you!"
185,"Beautiful Bali is an exceptional cultural experience. It mixes modern busy Bali {Ubud) with authentic village experiences.

He helped all of us in our group have a totally memorable experience."
186,"Highly recommend this trip to get an insight into the culture of Bali. It's well planned and has a good amount of interaction with local people. The accommodation, travel and food provided is excellent. Our guide, Putra, was excellent in helping us to understand more about the Balinese culture, its history and its people. The whole trip is well run, very professional."

188,"A fun and fully emersive deep dive into the intriguing and vibrant culture, food, religion and diverse landscapes of this beautiful Island. Our approachable and knowledgeable guide really brought this trip to life. Everyday is a treat. Delivered beyond expectation."
189,"The Beautiful Bali trip was amazing. The itinerary was packed with fun and interesting activities, with a lot of interaction with local Balinese people. I learned a lot about the local culture, customs, and religion. I even learned a few Indonesian words! I recommend this trip 100%."

This trip was an amazing experience and I look forward to many more."
196,This trip was amazing. Everything was well planned. The tourist guide Guna was exceptional very kind and taking care of people during the trip.

198,A great way to explore the back country of Bali and experience real people‚Äôs lives without sacrificing comfort. Great value for money.
199,Brillanten informative and immersive trip giving great insight into Balinese culture and traditions. Fast paced. Consider booking another few add on days to relax!
200,"A great trip with a great guide. I highly recommend it if you want to know more about Balinese culture. Our guide Wayan was highly professional, passionate and knowledgeable about Bali. Beautiful Bali deserves its name."
201,"My spontaneous Bali trip with Intrepid was unforgettable! Bring a headlamp for the volcano climb (I don't recommend just using your phone's light since you will need your hands to hold on to a walking stick and to keep your balance with the other) and warm clothes for the morning sunrise. The sunrise view is breath-taking, and snorkelling is spectacular with abundant fish and a healthy reef. Wayan, our guide, suggested amazing places to eat."
202,Spicy spice the best tour leader in the game. Thanks for a great trip!
203,"Perfect balance of activities, culture education and guidance from Spicy who was the best possible tour guide we could have asked for. We felt incredibly privileged to learn about and see a side of Bali most travellers never get the chance to. Highly recommend!"

206,Intrepid are an excellent tour company to travel with. You experience everything within the local culture!
207,Utterly amazing trip. Very well organised with some breathtaking memories created. We definitely saw a different side of Bali with Intrepid than staying in a hotel resort. Thank You!
208,"A great tour covering the natural wonders of Bali. You get to explore the best bits in a tight timeframe, with nice outdoor events to keep you busy. The Homestay did have an unauthentic feel with not enough time to get to know the people but it was still very enjoyable and good for the villagers. I Gede Putra was a wonderful Guide, sharing a lot of insight to the Balinese culture."
209,"Incredible trip!!!!! Our tour leader, Putra, was nothing short of amazing. He went above and beyond to ensure our journey was an unforgettable experience. The memories we created will stay with us forever. Along the way, we had the pleasure of meeting some truly heartwarming individuals. One of them was the sweet local guide, Wayan, who charmed us with his informative stories about the local village. His warm hospitality made our experience even more special. The 3am hike to Mount Batur stands out as one of the highlights of the trip. The stunning views at the sunset hour were absolutely breathtaking. Despite my initial worries about finding vegetarian options, I was delighted by the diverse and satisfying food choices available to us. Putra made it his priority to ensure that everyone was happy and well-fed throughout the trip. I can't recommend this experience highly enough to anyone looking to break out of their comfort zone, forge new friendships, and unearth Bali's hidden treasures. This journey was a perfect blend of excitement, laughter, incredible adventures, and visits to some of the most stunning sceneries I've ever seen."
210,"This trip is great! On the tour I was taken to various different places to experience Balinese culture. Putra is an absolutely wonderful leader. From the very start, he is welcoming and always has a smile. He is very informative and provided us with excellent information about Balinese culture and cuisine. He is always patient, very caring and made sure we were safe at all times. I would definitely highly recommend Putra as he is a wonderful guide and an even more amazing person. I cannot praise him enough! Thank you so much, Putra."

213,"This trip was our first with Intrepid, and I would happily do another. We got to see so many different things and also meet the local people and enjoy hands on experiences with them. We are a family of 5 and this was a great way to do a variety of things and not have to organise it all ourselves. It was wonderful to meet other travellers too, from many different countries! Our guide Alan and driver Made were capable, experienced and friendly people who looked after us so well and everything ran smoothly. It really was an unforgettable and rich holiday."
214,I would highly recommend Intrepid‚Äôs Beautiful Bali trip to anyone who wants to make the most of their time in Bali.
215,"A wonderful way to experience the culture, cuisine and environment of Bali for the first time. So many activities and destinations that seemed to flow effortlessly into each other. There is no way we would have experienced this much on our own steam; and made all the more fun with a small group that feel like family by the end of the trip."

219,"Beautiful Bali is an amazing tour filled with watching a stunning sunrise at Mt Batur to cycling through the rice fields, to snorkelling and seeing amazing coral, fish and sea turtles. Visiting Temples to meeting the local Balinese people and experiencing their cultural heritage, to monkey forest and experiencing a Kecap Dance to chanting music. A truly magical experience to discover!"
220,"The Bali trip was our first Intrepid tour & first trip to Bali. Our tour leader was very professional & organised, approachable & caring. The trip went very smoothly, & we saw & learnt lots, had many laughs & made new friends."
221,Beautiful Bali was just the trip I needed! It was well organised by our leader Komang. It had a lovely mix of activities to participate in and extra activities to fit in if you prefer. A great mix of destinations to get a mix of Bali experiences as well as fun fellow travellers to enjoy it with and make connections. Highly recommended! Carla
222,"I had a brilliant trip with our wonderful, knowledgeable leader Koman. The highlights were mount batur and snorkelling in lovina. It was incredible to see the north of the island staying with the local people and experiencing their way of life. Highly recommend it"
223,"As so many intrepid reviews go, this was my first time as a solo traveller and my first intrepid trip. It has been a truly life changing experience making new friends and memories. I will absolutely be booking more trips in the future and can't wait for the next adventure."
224,"Our local tour leader, Wayan, was absolutely AMAZING!!!!! I booked this trip last minute and had absolutely NO expectations. I was honestly convinced by the summary and did not read through the full itinerary and was shocked at how many activities were involved, but it was all well paced and very organized. The accommodations were great and kept getting better and better as we traveled around the island. Definitely bring some good hiking boots, the Mt Batur hike is stunning and snorkeling in the bluest waters I have ever seen was a dream!! The locals in Bali are such warm and friendly people and can't forget their food! Every meal was so fresh and delicious, they had many vegetarian options for myself and a couple others in our group. Again it was because of our leader, Wayan, that the trip so enjoyable. He was very kind, knowledgeable and always went out of his way to make sure the group was happy and safe (most importantly). This was my first solo international trip traveling from the US and I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who is considering it... Just do it!!!! You won't regret it :)"
225,"I embarked on the Beautiful Bali tour with a certain amount of ‚Äòintrepidation‚Äô basing my booking purely on reviews. My experience went way beyond any expectations I had- seamlessly organised, fun and an unforgettable trip seeing Bali in an intimate way."

228,Beautiful Bali indeed! I had a fantastic time on this trip with a wonderful group of people. Not everyone was aware that this trip can carry on in to Lombok with ‚ÄòBali and Lombok adventure‚Äô that‚Äôs the trip I did and I highly recommend covering both Bali and Lombok!
229,"Thank you Intrepid and our tour leader Srix for the most incredible Bali experience. It was lovely to see the real Bali, meet the people and take in the wonderful sites and experiences. I could not have created this experience myself. With such a knowledgeable leader we were able to understand and experience the culture fully. I will definitely use and recommend Intrepid in the future."
230,This trip Beautiful Bali is ideal for travellers. Tourists won't leave beaches and bars of Kuta and Seminak etc. If you want to see and experience the authentic Bali this is the trip for you. The real Bali is deeply spiritual away from the tourist areas. Highly recommended
231,I did this tour last year by myself and again this year with my wife because I enjoyed it so much. The itinerary was similar and both tours made me feel like it was an inaugural trip for Intrepid. I like their approach and the genuine enthusiasm of the leaders. And I liked the conservative and safe drivers. I would recommend the trip.
232,This was my first experience with Intrepid Toirs and it was a fantastic experience. I would Highly recommend for holidaymakers that like to be on the go and discovering new places.
233,"No regrets, a fantastic yet speedy trip through some amazing areas of Bali. We moved location almost every day so minimal free time, but great experience and fantastic group of people including our guide."

238,"Great trip, very well organised, small group. Loved getting to know the culture, people and traditions. Great variety of activities included in the trip. One of the best holidays I had. Thank you"
239,"Really enjoyed the trip, have grown a lot as an individual from it. Would have appreciated a few more tourist/popular activities included in the itinerary, but you'll have a great time in Bali either way."
240,"Overall a very fun and enjoyable trip! The group dynamic was fantastic and I really enjoyed many of the included activities, especially the cycling and volcano climb. I would say however that spending only 1 night in each place did feel a bit rushed and exhausting packing and unpacking. The quality of the hotel rooms also varied from person to person. Additional activities such as the cooking class were also often overlooked due to time restrictions which made many of these options quite redundant as we rarely had time to do them."
241,My experience was lovely and the tour leader was even lovelier which made the trip wonderful.
242,"The trip was great, so good to see Bali authentically with such a knowledgeable guide!"
243,Beautiful Bali trip was my second trip with Intrepid and my favourite trip overall. Bali is a wonderful place but going with a group really allows you to experience and see Bali authentically as well as staying in gorgeous towns and villages - highly recommend
244,"Great mix of activities and downtime with Mt. Batur and snorkeling as the highlights. The homestay in Sibetan was very well done and we enjoyed getting to know the people. Our guide, Ima, was friendly, knowledgeable, and facilitated the trip well."
245,An amazing experience you‚Äôll never regret
246,This trip was exceptional. I had the best time. The Mt Batur hike and the snorkelling were my highlight. Our group leader Wira was wonderful and I learned so much about the Balinese culture.
247,Beautiful Bali was a great way to see a bit of everything for first time visit here. Our leader Wira was great and we had lovely people in our group. I would not have experienced the things we did without this tour. Well worthwhile for first time here. I‚Äôm glad I had the opportunity to have my own room for chill out time.
248,"Well laid out iternary, good accommodation, great team leader. Home stay at Sibetan village was very special. Snorkeling was way beyond my expectations and the sight felt out of this world. The local guides were also excellent."
249,"Our 9 day trip to Bali, Indonesia with Intrepid was exhilarating. Experiencing their Village life, walking amidst Rice fields, learning about their ART & CULTURE, trekking up the Volcano Baatu, snorkeling in the sea, having exotic sea food, getting relaxing foot massages has left me craving for more such adventure !"
250,"Well laid out iternary, good accommodation, great team leader. Home stay at Sibetan village was very special. Snorkeling was way beyond my expectations and the sight felt out of this world. The local guides were also excellent."

We were immersed in authentic local experiences, far from the typical Instagram influencer spots, which allowed us to fully embrace the culture and traditions. This journey touched my heart and created memories that will last a lifetime."
256,"The trip was wonderful. All expectations were exceeded. Apart from a few tourist spots, we spent most of our time with the locals. The real Bali is beautiful. Our guide Wira was great and we had the best time together. My highlight was certainly snorkelling with a turtle and the sunrise at Mount Batur. Everything was well organised and I would do the tour again any time. Thank you for everything Wira!"
257,This itinerary has been outstanding. Seeing that there is more to Bali than just beach clubs and markets. I learnt so much about Indonesian culture and Bali's way of life. Visiting places with very few tourists was a highlight. The homestay experience will be something I remember for my whole life. They welcome you like you are family. The best part of the trip for me was the snorkelling. It was like being in a heated tropical fish tank. Huge amount of fish and the colours were amazing. I just couldn't believe my eyes. It's been a really great active trip!
258,Amazing experience of northern Bali the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Bali away from the tourist areas of the south coast. I learnt so much about a Bali history and culture and especially loved the home stay. Our tour guide Wira was brilliant and made the trip so fun!
259,"This Bali trip exceeded my expectations after experiencing busy Ubud. A perfect balance of adventure and fun and exploration. Well organised with great guides, we thoroughly enjoyed our first experience with Intrepid"
260,"The pace, stays, excursions are excellent I highly recommend this tour and company."

262,The Beautiful Bali trip was an incredible experience to discover the real Bali and learn about the island. An exceptionally well organised trip covering a wide range of activities and sights led by a superb guide called Guna who was very knowledgeable..
263,"Wonderful Immersive Experience! Highly recommend Beautiful Bali trip. Fantastic itinerary, Guna was a truly amazing caring guide, well organized and met a wonderful group of people. Trip of a lifetime. Thank-you Intrepid!"
264,I was alittle hesitant with a tour for my trip to Bali but I‚Äôm glad I did it. Saw soo much and gained so many new friends I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll have for life. Highly recommend especially for new places.
265,Great way to see a lot of Bali easily with parts that are a little off mainstream.
266,"Beautiful Bali was indeed a fabulous guided tour of authentic Balinese culture, blended with plenty of time for rest, relaxation, loads of hydro therapy and delicious fresh healthy food, pure fruit juices and many low cost professional massages. Our guides Wayan and Kormang were outstanding with their care and perfect organisation skills. They were also very entertaining!! The accommodation was a blend of rustic home stay to boutique hotels or resorts with lush pool areas . Thank you again guys for all your hard work in making the trip so enjoyable."
267,I would highly recommend this tour for variety if activities and understanding the Balinese culture with a view to protecting the environment and supporting local peoples
268,"Had a brilliant trip covered so much of Bali in such a short space of time. Saw things I never would have otherwise, tried so many local foods even fruits I‚Äôd never heard of. The minibus driving us round was nice and spacious with good air conditioning. Wayan and Komang were great leaders"
269,This was the first time we had used Intrepid for any sort of holiday/tour and cannot fault them in that information provided was clear and in accordance with expectations from the travel information provided when we booked our holiday. Would highly recommend to anyone considering this type of tour.
270,"This trip was amazing! We really got a wonderful taste of Bali. Our leader, Abraham, was wonderful, knowledgeable, and caring. I would totally recommend this trip to those who want to really experience all sides of Bali."
271,"This trip was packed with experiences I never would have found on my own. I especially loved the focus on experiencing the authentic Balinese way of life. It made the whole experience so much richer. Lots of fun activities as well - early hiking and amazing snorkeling. Our guide, Lena, was an absolute gem. She was incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and always made sure we felt comfortable and safe."
272,"I chose to visit Bali with a friend and wanted to see less of the beach front tourism and more cultural experiences. This was definitely the right trip! Between the villages and home stay, local foods, and our exceptional local guide Lena, I feel like we‚Äôve learnt a lifetime of valuable cultural information, experienced life in Bali, and not at the cost of relaxation, swimming, beaches and good times with fellow travellers. The cycling, snorkelling and hiking were all such positive experience and complimented well by the abundance of hot springs, massages and spa treatments. I would recommend this trip to others, and even do the exact trip again myself!"
273,"I can't say enough about this trip - It's an incredible value, full of life-changing experiences and things to see and do. Big shout-out to Lena our fearless leader who made it extra special!"
274,"Beautiful Bali was just that! We had so much fun snorkeling, river rafting, hiking Mt Batur, visiting the Hidden Garden Teas/Coffee & Cocoa during a rainforest down pour. Tours of the rice fields on bikes and foot were delightfully green! We got to taste home cooking Bali style along with our welcoming Homestay. So many fun memories of laughter, singing & dancing...I love Bali!"
275,"Brilliant, amazing, wonderful. Think of the best word you know. Double it. This trip was like that!!! Don‚Äôt think twice. Book it now!!! You won‚Äôt regret it!"
276,"A good trip with a mix of included activities. the food in bali is great. Accommodation on the whole is good, although Intrepid now seem include a shocker of hotel where you will not want to sleep. If you do book this trip i would recommended extra time at the start or end as the trip does not visit everywhere. make sure you go to Nusa Penida, some of the best beaches in the world. Lombok and Gill Islands are worth staying on for too"
277,"A great way to experience Bali and appreciate Balinese culture. The perfect balance of included and optional activities, allowing free time. The Mount Batur sunrise hike and local homestay we're just a couple of my favourite parts of the trip."
278,"I highly recommend the Beautiful Bali tour. Tour leader was great, huge variety of activities/ places visited and people in the group were lovely. Great experience and lots of fun."
279,"The Beautiful Bali trip is a special trip that gives you experiences outside the typical tourist agenda. Every decision is intentional to help uplift the community. Our guide, Fidel, was truly the best!"

281,Beautiful Bali is exactly that. What an uplifting spiritual trip this was. There was so much packed into the agenda and such varied travel experiences. Such good value for such an awesome trip. Local guides were great and the tour guide was brilliant. Highly recommend this trip. Such a great way to travel.
282,I cannot express how amazing this trip was! Our leader was so knowledgeable about the places we visited and we got the opportunity to visit some ‚Äúoff the beaten track‚Äù places that I would never have visited on my own. I loved the snorkelling and sunrise hike - they were magical memories!
283,"I really enjoyed visiting rural Bali, a real contrast to resort style Bali, and meeting so many humble beautiful people."
284,Tour covered lots of Bali but the problem is that Bali is only ok/ wouldn‚Äôt go back. It‚Äôs for Instagram obsessed teenagers and not nearly as pretty as Thailand plus food is pretty bland.
285,"Fantastic trip. Lena, our guide was amazing and it felt like a very cultural, local journey through Bali."
286,"I wasn't ready for this trip to end- I learnt so much about this amazing island and it's beautiful people. The range of activities was diverse and challenged me physically, but the experiences in this trip is something that will stay with me always. And the food was some of the best I've ever had. Our guide Lena was extremely knowledgeable and her love of her country and culture was evident. She was friendly, warm and I always felt safe and comfortable to approach her for anything."
287,This trip was amazing Bali is an incredible destination and it‚Äôs culture is vibrant. Experiencing Bali is a must.
288,"This was my first time travelling with Intrepid, and I cannot recommend it more. The focus on local culture was so important. We met so many wonderful people. A truly memorable experience!"

290,"The best holiday I have ever been on, enjoyable with local experiences and a lot of focus on responsible tourism."
291,A great experience! This trip has inspired me to book a trip with intrepid annually .
292,A very fully packed trip of early starts and mini bus travelling but essential to get the best experience of Bali. A lot of whistle stops and living out of your suitcase day by day which didn't bother us and just added to the fun and adventure. Just a tip make sure you read all the trip information before you book as I think some travellers expectations were higher than what was actually advertised but we thought it was fantastic value for money with a lovely guide Lena who was very caring and friendly and always on hand for questions
293,What a way to travel!!! Loved the organization and not having to plan all of that stuff out. Was able to experience the culture from a local who understands. Phenomenal trip.
294,"The Beautiful Bali trip was exceptional. From the quality of the itinerary, accommodation, tour guide (Moshi) and driver (Rafi). I can't wait to go on my next Intrepid trip!"
295,"A fantastic trip - Bali is truly beautiful. Lots of different experiences on this trip that I would never had done if I had organised it myself. Great trip leader, lovely hotels and activities - VERY good value for money in my opinion."
296,"Great itinerary, including many parts of Bali I probably would not have seen if I had planned the trip myself. I would leave extra time before or after the trip to see the manta rays of Nusa Penida and check out other temples of interest. Some might consider Gili Islands. So much to do and see in Bali!"
297,"Our trip to Bali was highly enjoyable - great itinerary which packed a lot in without ever feeling rushed. Exceptional tour guide. Nova, who really cared about his groups experience."
298,"Excellent, varied trip with outstanding leader and informative local guides. Would recommend!"
299,This trip is the perfect combination of sightseeing and relaxing. The hike up the volcano is an absolute highlight which is also the day with the snorkeling. Everyone in Bali is so very friendly and helpful. Highlight recommend this tour.
300,"This was a brilliant, fun, and surprising trip that left us feeling refreshed, with lots of great memories. Highly recommended."
301,The Intrepid Tour of Bali is a fantastic way to see and experience a different culture and see more of the island than just relaxing at a resort.
302,"Beautiful Bali was absolutely beautiful stunning trip. We have learned a lot about balinase culture. Guna the group leader was very friendly, easy to reach and knowledgeable. The hight of the trip was watching the sunrise from the top of Mt Batur and the snorkeling."
303,"I'm so glad I did this! I was so apprehensive and I thought I'll be fine to do my own trip and on my own... But this was a much better, safer and lovlier experience. Our leader Srix was amazing, we saw bits of Bali we wouldn't have seen as a tourist, my group was so lovely, everyone got on, I am now looking for my next Intrepid trip :-)"
304,"The best purchase of my life. You see all the amazing sites of Bali, planned all for you, with the perfect amount of free time and included activities. Could not recommend more!"
305,"An excellent insight into real Balinese life, culture and people. An active tour but not rushed with enough downtime to feel relaxed. This trip allows you to see a lot of Bali that most tourists would never see, hidden gems of scenery and super friendly people. We were welcomed into the community and traditional ceremony preparations with such genuine hospitality. Had great fun and wonderful memories created. Srix, our leader made the trip special."
306,"I had an amazing time on this trip with a fantastic group of people. Our tour guide Wayan was absolutely wonderful, his love of Bali and his passion came across throughout the trip. He is a very special person who made the trip a great experience for everyone, he could not have done more for us. We got to see the ‚Äòreal Bali‚Äô and were really immersed in the culture - it is a beautiful place. I would highly recommend the trip."
307,This was an amazing trip that really was a lot of fun to see a new part of the world.
308,"I would highly recommend this trip. Nine days is a perfect amount of time to explore Bali in a unique way. Lots of adventure, spiritual experiences, sensational food and a wonderful guide in Wayan. I travelled as a single traveller, I felt safe and cared for at all times. If in doubt; book it."
309,An unforgettable travel experience worth of a second or more visits
310,"An exceptionally enjoyable, fun, and exciting adventure in a tropical paradise. Tini surpassed my expectations as a reliable, helpful and organized leader. I cannot recommend too highly this trip, the organization, attention to safety requirements, concern for environmental issues and overall quality. I met some really lovely, well travelled and interesting fellow travelers. Looking forward to my next adventure with Intrepid, assured I will be in safe hands."
311,Please use comments in previous section!
312,This was one of the most special trips I have ever been on.
313,Beautiful Bali was a fantastic trip which really opened my eyes on the culture of Balinese people.
314,"This was a great trip with so much adventure shared with small group of likeminded travelers: starting from attending temples, having a breathtaking swing over the wonderful rice fields, snorkeling to observe a beauty of the undersea life, having lunch at the deer only island, hiking the volcano at 3 am in the morning to see the beauty of the sun rise, stopping by the water falls, testing local food and many more! The trip with lots of memories to cherish through the years!"
315,It was the first experience for me to travel to Bali and with a group. Guna was good tour guide with great hospitality. He was friendly and enthusiastic during the trip. He quickly answered any question from the group. Thanks Guna!
316,The Beautiful Bali trip with Yan as a trip leader was exceptional. I can not rate this trip highly enough and feel sorry for those that visit Bali with out this amazing experience.
317,The Beautiful Bali trip is amazing. There is so much more to see in Bali than the busy beaches and resorts. This trip truly lived up to its name. The people are just as beautiful as the itinerary.

321,Beautiful Bali was the best group tour I have ever done. We were so embraced by the locals and many experiences would not have been possible outside of this tour. Lena our guide was incredible and the accomodation was lovely. I cannot recommend this trip enough. Many lifetime memories made.
322,"This was my first time on an organised trip having always planned my trips myself and I was so impressed by the Beautiful Bali tour - the route, the activities, the accommodation and in particular our tour leader Andy Swandi"
323,A great introduction to Bali with all of the highlight stops covered by the tour. Our guide was fantastic! Would thoroughly recommend
324,Thanks for a great trip.
325,"This is a fast-paced trip that truly shows the beauty of Bali. I enjoyed every activity, even the quite difficult 3am hike up to Mount Batur - the view really is worth it! The snorkeling, rice fields, and culture are fantastic. The food was delicious and Balinese massages are the best!"
326,"Great tour, knowledgeable and friendly guide. Authentic food and cultural experiences, varied experiences and scenery with fun activities. A well organised company and our guide Pelguna looked after us well."
327,"This trip was 10/10. The perfect balance of action and relaxation. A great option if you‚Äôre travelling alone. I learned so much more about the customs and culture of Bali than I would have if travelling without a tour. A small group of max 12 adults meant that we all became very close and formed friendships that will carry on beyond the tour. Our tour leader Yan was passionate, approachable and generous with his extensive knowledge of Balinese culture. Even if you‚Äôve been to Bali before, I promise this tour is a must do!!"
328,"Beautiful Bali was the perfect trip for a travel novice like me. Intrepid was so helpful with organising airport transfers and extra night‚Äôs accommodation. The trip was so much fun, balanced with local walks through the villages and exciting physical activities with knowledgeable guides. Loved it!"
329,"Amazing experience, a well planned out trip. Highly recommend"
330,This trip was a really good introduction for me to the balinese culture.
331,Review pending resolution of damaged baggage
332,"As a novice traveller, I can‚Äôt rate this trip highly enough. We were looked after beautifully by our group leader who guided us on local customs and the activities and pace of the itinerary worked well. Small group of 12 was lovely"
333,"I would recommend this trip to anyone. It allows you to use your time taking in all that is great in Bali without wasting time staring at your phone trying to organise your next stop. It incorporates the culture and gives a great insight into the lives of local people. It was great to meet new people in our group too and lots of fun was had. This trip was amazing and allows you to sit back and enjoy, every step."
334,"Beautiful Bali trip is a great way to see and learn about all aspects of Bali - the culture, the people, the environment , the food and the way of life. A very interesting country with a beautiful culture and ethos‚Ä¶ Thank you to Corry, an excellent guide who made the trip so good."
335,"This is great tour of Bali, its beauty, and culture. It‚Äôs a more active trip but not the most demanding. Accommodations are not luxury but comfortable, most have aircon. If you book, ask for Tini as tour guide!"
336,"The tour beautiful Bali was just an amazing trip for me. I would highly recommend this tour, if you are intrested in the culture of Bali. The sunrisehike and the snorkling were my highlights, which I will never forget. If you have Tini as your guide, you will have a great time in Bali."
337,"Intrepid is a great tour provider for the informed traveller to cares about Responsible Tourism and their footprint on this world. I would recommend using this provider to anyone who wants a great, informed trip with lots of included activities and local experiences."
338,"Amazing trip, where you really get to know the true Bali culture? 10/10 recommend!"
339,"The entire tour was an absolutely fantastic experience! Our guide, Fidel Yuwono, made sure that we not only bonded like a family in no time, but also took great care of us by answering all our questions, assisting us throughout, and ensuring that we had not just a good time, but the absolute best one. Every place we visited was brimming with history, intricate details, and warm, friendly faces. We accomplished so much in such a short span of time, and we genuinely feel that without this tour, we wouldn't have been able to truly grasp the essence of Bali. We cherished every single minute of it!"
340,This was an amazing and unique tour with a lot of unforgettable moments. Thanks to our excell guide Fidel!!!
341,Had an amazing time in Bali with my group! Ell was an amazing tour guide! Very knowledgeable and friendly!
342,"I enjoyed an amazing trip with lots of fun activities. I liked, that we could have a look inside the ‚Äöreal bali‚Äò side. We met local people & they were so friendly. Everyone wants to help & show us their culture. Thank you!"
343,"Was a great trip, great exposure to the true non-touristic sides of Bali and local culture and lifestyle, but also nicely balanced with nice hotels equipped with pools and spas. We ate very well on the trip and our tour guide was super friendly and helpful! Thanks for great memories."
344,The Beautiful Bali trip is an excellent choice for those who want to see the main spots in Bali. It includes both relaxing and active activities. I really enjoyed the itinerary.
345,"This trip is a great way of seeing the real Bali away from the busy resort towns. The bike ride and mountain climb were a challenge for me but I enjoyed them. Snorkeling was beautiful and much better than I expected. Beautiful fish and we incredibly saw a whale shark. Comfortable rooms, great guide and safe driver. Stay for a couple of days at the end to relax at a pool."
346,‚ÄúBeautiful Bali‚Äù was a great introduction to the more picturesque and less touristy parts of the island. It was helped by being with a great group of people who bonded quickly under the excellent guidance of Wayan.
347,Loved this trip. Our guide Wayan was an excellent source of information. The Mt Batur and snorkelling experiences were my favourite.
348,"This was my first ever solo trip and I was so nervous about it, but it turned out to be one of the best experiences of my life! The trip was absolutely amazing and covered all aspects of Bali, I feel like I discovered the ins and outs of this beautiful island, from beaches to villages, mountains, nature, cities, and my fave: the volcano hike at sunrise, it was absolutely breathtaking! I also enjoyed spending time with the locals and tasting their food! The group was lovely, our ages ranged from 20s to 60s but we all got along and had fun together, and shout out to our guide Vehad who was very helpful and nice! Highly recommended!"
349,"We had the best time on our Beautiful Bali trip! Our leader Vahed was excellent, the activities and local guides were amazing and the accomodation was great. Would highly recommend this tour and Intrepid in general!"
350,"It was my first group trip and I will definitely repeat. Everything has been fantastic, especially the leader."
351,It was a really good experience. You are in contact with local people and far of the touristic places. 100% recomend
352,"Loved Beautiful Bali. A fantastic introduction to this beautiful place. Diverse activities, lots of cultural knowledge and a great way to see more of Bali than the usual touristy areas. Highlights were learning about offerings, the homestay and climbing Mt Batur. Thank you to our group for the laughs and Wayan our leader!"
353,"Fantastic location, Beautiful places, Amazing weather, happy very friendly people. This trip inspired me and improved my physical & mental health -Jola-"
354,"This trip was incredible, the right mix of activities and culture. Yan the tour leader was wonderful and the group were great. I just wished I had done the full trip including the islands. Highly recommend."
355,Well organized trip with a great leader. Bali is beautiful and the local people are really kind. Good transport by minibus.
356,Beautiful Bali was my first Intrepid trip and I travelled alone. It was an amazing cultural experience in a totally safe environment. I would definitely do another intrepid trip in the future
357,"Fantastic trip. Lots packed into a short space of them. Great mix of outdoors, culture and site seeing. The tour guide Wayan was great, you get the feeling you were getting a real ‚Äúbehind the scenes‚Äù experience. Snorkelling and mountain hike were the highlight."
358,"This was an excellent tour, our leader taught us so much about Balinese culture and religion. It was a perfect balance of seeing the busy parts of bali along with the more remote villages and communities off the beaten path. If you want to enjoy bali but also leave with a more holistic appreciation of their culture and practices, this is a trip for you. The hotel/home stay accommodations are very fine but not ‚Äúfive star‚Äù, just for you to be aware. I‚Äôm so glad I did this tour, it was very well organized and we saw such beautiful parts of bali and wonderful interactions with locals. Definitely plan to stay a few days before or after to relax because you won‚Äôt get too much down time on this trip!"
359,"The tour was a great way to see Bali for the first time. Everyone in our group got on and our leader Sirx was great, as a local she was very friendly and knowledgeable and nothing was too much trouble. The early morning start and walk up the mountain is worth it once you get to the top and see the sun rise then in the evening you can be sat on the beach with a beer and see the sun setting. Would recommended the tour to anyone going to Bali for the first time."
360,"The beautiful Bali tour was amazing. If your looking for an off the beaten track adventure that allows you to connect with people, place and culture in a meaningful way then this is for you. A well designed itinerary that balances activities with downtime and rest. It never felt like we were bouncing from place to place just for the selfie. Our time was intentional & focussed on having a meaningful experience at every place we stopped. Comfortable accommodation, much more than what I expected. Knowledgeable Tour and village guides who give you an indepth understanding of their unique culture & way of life. Highly recommend this well curated trip."
361,"As a fairly active person who wanted a balance of activity, relaxation and learning about the local culture, this trip was ideal. Srix, our tour guide, really made the trip excellent."
362,"Enjoyed this trip and Srix was a wonderful tour guide. Truly got to appreciate all aspects of Balinese culture and I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve been able to if I travelled without a tour. Although the hotels were not 5 star (which I did not expect), I would still rate this tour 10/10. Especially if you are traveling long distances, it was a great experience that was not just beach and pool. Bali weather is hot - a portable fan is a must for the bus!"
363,"Nice tour and gets off the tourist hotspots. The hike up mountain requires walking boots and not trainers, bit more difficult than expected. A great trip to see the real Bali and not just the tourist spots. Favourite was the day snorkelling, crystal clear waters."
364,"I really enjoyed my trip. We were busy and active and the days seem to be jam packed but also filled with some down time. Visiting the homestay and locals for dinner was some of my favorite items, as well as trekking mt batur. My group had mixed ages but we all got along well! Overall I had a blast!"
365,"My Bali trip with Intrepid was an absolute delight! From lush landscapes to vibrant culture, every moment was enchanting. Tini, our guide, made it extraordinary. Her knowledge and warmth added depth to our experience. I'm grateful for this incredible journey, filled with adventure and guided by someone as amazing as Tini!"
366,"Take the trip, you will not regret it. My experience was incredible and our tour guide, Tini, was amazing"
367,Tini was a wonderful leader who showed us the beautiful parts of Bali that are away from the main tourist drag! The trip has a good balance of included activities and covers a diverse range of Balinese life. Included meals and homestay were fabulous.... a great insight into Balinese life.
368,Intrepid provided an excellent tour with an exceptional tour guide (Tini). It was a great way to experience Bali in a safe way.
369,The beautiful Bali trip was amazing it‚Äôs was everything and more! Our guide Lena was incredible she made the trip for us. She is so knowledgeable and really made us feel like a part of the culture. All of the local guides were amazing and so welcoming to us into their homes/areas. It was an amazing experience that I would 1000% recommend to anyone who wants to see the real Bali!
370,"Really amazing trip, our guide Lena was really friendly and knowledgable. There was a brilliant variety of locations, activities and accommodation. The perfect balance of organised activities and free time. We had a local Balinese experience with real insights into the culture."
371,This was a beautiful trip and more than I could have asked for. A great introduction to a first time in Bali and first time with Intrepid.
372,"This trip was an amazing experience for me, it gave me insight of Balinese culture, traditions and history. It was wonderful adventure to start with incredible activities and experiences to be remembered. The trip also allowed me to get to know with local villagers and learned about their lifestyle, and tried delicious local food."
373,"This has been my favorite trip so far! With this tour you are not going to the most touristic spots of Bali or the instagram destinations. You will have a more authentic experience! For the first time in vacation, I had the experience of being immersed in a culture to the point to understand it more than a surface level. The highlights for me were going to a balinese house and learn how to do an offering and the meaning of it, the homestay and all the local meals that where included. The snorkelling was also amazing! Our Guide Guna loves Bali and he tries to share his culture so you can have a better understanding of the balinese. He had great suggestions of spotsto have dinner in each place that the food wasn't included and the was always trying to coordinate everything to have a great experience.The hotels were really good considering that this is a Basic tour. Definitely I will recommend this tour!"
374,Beautiful Bali was my first Intrepid trip and I travelled alone. It was an amazing cultural experience in a totally safe environment. I saw abs experienced many Thai gs I would never have done alone.
375,"This trip ticked all the boxes for me, every step of the way was enjoyable and our guide Yan was just perfect and I couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better trip and guide."
376,"Yan, our group leader, made this trip so special! This is a busy trip but a great way to see Bali if you haven‚Äôt got unlimited time to travel around the island - would definitely recommend!!"
377,"For anyone thinking of doing this trip I would highly recommend! It‚Äôs was amazing from start to finish, immersing you into the Bali culture and way of life. An absolutely amazing experience!!"
378,"This trip pushed me out of my comfort zone which is exactly what I needed. I have never laughed so much in my entire life and the group were so beautiful and supportive. Yan was the star! We all agreed the trip would have been very different if we had a different team leader. He was oozing positivity and was so well organised as well as skilled at making sure the trip went smoothly and we were all happy and felt included. I would highly recommend any trip he is the leader of, as an introvert I managed 9 days with a group of complete strangers many of whom I now call friends. I pushed myself to try new things and learn about a different culture and I feel like a new person with a far more positive outlook on life. Thank you so much Intrepid, i will definitely be booking again."
379,"As a solo traveller this was everything I could have hoped for, a well constructed itinerary where I saw so much more than if I‚Äôd done it myself, an excellent guide and a really nice group. Perfect break."
380,"Fantastic trip! Highly recommend. Guna our tour guide was so knowledgable, approachable and super accommodating. A jam packed trip and very insightful."
381,"Beautiful Bali is an exceptional tour which explores the 'real' Bali, with much time spent away from the main tourist areas. An activity-packed schedule took us on an adventure through bustling towns and villages, to beautiful rural areas (rice fields and local plantations), including time spent with local communities. Watching the sun rise from the top of Mount Batur and snorkelling above the coral reefs of Manjangan island are once-in-a-lifetime experiences which I will never forget."
382,What an amazing experience! From the time we met the group until our last day. A great insight to Bali. Our group leader Ari was excellent and made the trip for us. The mt Batur climb was worth the hike. We made great friends and saw the beauty of Bali. Book it!
383,"If you‚Äôve never been to Bali before or experienced it via an organised tour, then I‚Äôd say Intrepid is the one for you. Amazing experience."
384,"Beautiful Bali was an extraordinary experience. During the trip, we had the opportunity to visit several places and stay with the local people, learn the local culture, and enjoy the amazing locations. I special thanks to our guide, Corry Aritona, who was able to organize a fantastic journey."
385,"I highly recommend Beautiful Bali with Intrepid. Despite being to Bali a few times before, I was able to see parts of Bali I would otherwise not see. A wonderful way to visit Bali and learn."
386,"I strongly recommend this trip! We had an authentic experience throughout which covered all bases - natural beauty, amazing food physical challenges, and spiritual and social connections. I was also a huge fan of our group leader Fidel. His knowledge and endless enthusiasm made the trip even better."
387,"We loved the Beautiful Bali trip led by our wonderful leader, Lena. Because of the interaction with many Balinese guides and community members, the trip gives an appreciation of Balinese home life as it is influenced by Hinduism, family traditions and the modern world. In addition the snorkelling, bike riding, and volcano sunrise trips in particular were very beautiful."
388,I can not recommend the Beautiful Bali tour enough. This trip was full of Balinese cultural & amazing activities. Our tour guide Lena was the highlight of our trip. She was extremely knowledgeable and professional is every way. Thank you Bali.
389,"You could explore Bali on your own accord, but chances are, you wouldn‚Äôt fully experience what Bali has to offer. The tour shows you the whole island, and the guides answer any questions you have about Balinese culture, traditions, and language. It‚Äôs worth the money, fully recommend!"
390,"If you want to experience the real Bali this is an awesome trip. Our leader Lena, our bus driver Made, our homestay, accommodation, food, mountain trek, cycling and snorkelling were excellent!"
391,Beautiful Bali is a trip that I will forever remember. We saw so much and met so many amazing people both local and as part of our group. This is the best experience we have been on! We are already booking our next Intrepid adventure.
392,My intrepid trip to Bali was an experience I will never forget. My incredible leader Srix and the people I met on the trip made my first solo travel experience so much fun. Learning the culture of Bali was amazing. I can‚Äôt wait for my next trip with Intrepid!
393,"This trip is, to some degree, about managing expectations. Bali is a densely populated island and mass tourism destination with all the related side effects. Within this context, Intrepid did a great job introducing us to the culture, people and natural features. However, if you are expecting a tropical paradise, you should probably look elsewhere."
394,"Our leader Yan made the trip so much fun, I loved his enthusiasm and sense of humour, you could tell he genuinely cared about us beyond just a professional duty of care. I learned so much about local culture and family life, great variety of activities and opportunities to see natural beauty, amazing food including local take away and home cooked dinners, which make you feel like you're closer to experiencing Bali rather than just as a tourist. Accommodation also exceeded my expectations with beautiful garden settings, amazing pools. Terima kasih banyak Yan and our superb driver Made. Bring warm clothes for the 2 nights in the hills and reapply sunscreen between the snorkelling sessions, and enjoy this amazing experience."
395,My husband and I did the Beautiful Bali tour for part of honeymoon and it was incredible! From start to finish the trip was brilliant we would 100% recommend Intrepid to anyone who wants to see the real Bali. We also must do a shout out to our amazing guide who went above and beyond to make our trip so special. Intrepid we will be back!!
396,Absolutely fantastic - cannot recommend this trip enough! An excellent way to gain a real cultural insight to Bali and get the most out of the island.
397,"Excellent experience! Loved the whole thing - I had never heard of Intrepid before but will definitely do another, so if you're wondering about the trip of a lifetime - do it! The excursions were a great way to learn and experience things I would never have seen otherwise and the views and gang I was with were all brilliant."
398,"A fantastic trip. Informative, varied, fun with great accommodation and food. Guide Wayan simply the best"
399,Thoroughly enjoyed this trip to the less well known areas of Bali. Activities were varied and interesting and our leader Wayan made sure we all had a great time.
400,"This was my 9th or 10th Intrepid Trip, so I've seen a lot of the world, and as I've been to Bali on four previous occasions, my expectations were not overly high, however I was blown away with this tour, I learnt so much and the inclusions and itinerary were brilliant. I loved this tour!"
401,Beautiful Bali was an excellent tour which exceeded my expectations. Wayan was a wonderful leader and the included activities and food were an interesting look into Balinese culture. Thoroughly enjoyed and considering another Intrepid tour very soon!
402,"Fantastic trip! Our guide Wayan was everything you'd want in a guide, friendly, organised, helpful, loveliest guy. Made, our very capable driver and we had brilliant local guides. Great mix of activities and locations, local village visit was very basic but it was fine, i loved seeing Bali from a different view. Mt Batur hard but worth it! Great trip overall, if you've never been it's an excellent starter visit. I'm planning my next trip already."
403,The itinerary for this trip is well paced with a variety of activities and time to relax. The drives are short (average 2 hrs) and stops auto break-up the journeys are well planned
404,"Incredible guide, tour group, local guides and people in general. Great balance between scheduled activities and personal time. Will definitely be doing another Intrepid tour in the near future"

410,"Beautiful Bali was the trip of a lifetime. I‚Äôve travelled globally but this trip is the one that will stay with me. Intrepid‚Äôs talent for mixing a countries highlights with community based tourism is brilliant. Our guide in Bali, Yan, was the best guide I‚Äôve ever had. He was professional yet friendly and so intuitive to the needs of all. I can‚Äôt recommend Bali with Intrepid enough."
411,"5* Trip This trip was beyond what I expected. I expected a fun, organised and interesting trip, which I did get, and then some. But the hidden gems such as the packed lunches wrapped in banana leaf and the organisation of the tour leader, as well as the excellent company, elevated this to the status of experience of a lifetime."
412,"We absolutelly loved this tour. Great itinerary, passionate tour leader, responsible tourism."
413,"The holiday in Bali was superb visiting much of the island. The group leader, Wayan, had great organisational skills and looked after the requirements of everyone. Particular highlights included the visit to Kedisan, the walk up the volcano to watch the sunrise, the quality and flavours of the food and the friendliness and welcoming nature of everyone we met. I would highly recommend this trip."
414,"The Beautiful Bali trip was an amazing way to see the real Bali, get a taste of the culture, meet the Bali people and gain a better appreciation of everything Bali. Could not recommend it enough. Do yourself a favour and don't just sit in a resort!"
415,Beautiful Bali was a wonderful educational and cultural experience. We highly recommend Srix as a guide!
416,This trip fits a lot of activities into a short space of time which is great if you want to make the most of a short time in Bali and really integrate into the culture. There‚Äôs not much time for relaxing during the trip so make sure to book some time for this before/after the tour.
417,"We have never been on an organized trip, before, but this Intrepid adventure holiday was a wonderful break! Tour guide Wira was utterly exceptional and ensured our holiday was magnificent! Thank you so much."
418,This was an amazing trip with a very varied itinerary led by an excellent tour guide - Nova. I‚Äôm still buzzing about having climbed Mr Batur to see sunrise and our home stay village experience was delightful.
419,"I would 100% recommend Intrepid for tours if you want to know more about your destination - especially if you want to do more off the beaten path, and learn about the culture and the way the locals live. Our guide was native and so knowledgable and friendly."
420,The Beautiful Bali trip was just that beautiful. I'm coming home so much more enriched and passionate about Bali and also travelling.
421,Beautiful Bali was a great way to experience Bali for the first time! Guna was a great guide with a lot of knowledge and made the trip wonderful!
422,"We had a great time on this trip. Wide variety of included activities (sightseeing, cycling, trekking and snorkeling) and we felt we really got a sense of the ""real"" Bali. Our guide Guna was excellent and ran the trip very well."
423,"Great trip to get an in depth look at the real Bali, with locations away from the touristy south. Loved Ubud, the rice terraces of Sideman, beautiful Mount Batur and lake, the beach on the north coast at Lovina and snorkeling at Menjangan island. Stayed in wonderful authentic local hotels, had great food and met lots of lovely local Balinese people. The tour guide Guna was fantastic, very kind and helpful. There is a lot of traveling on windy narrow roads by minibus, so not great for those with motion sickness. Didn‚Äôt enjoy the home stay experience and wasn‚Äôt up to the Mount Batur climb, but otherwise a great tour."
424,"Being from Perth, I have travelled to Bali many times yet still found this trip to offer something new every day. It takes you beyond the tourist centres and introduces a side of Bali you won‚Äôt see easily on your own. The hotels are real gems (including the homestays!) and there is a good mix of activities and down time. I thoroughly enjoyed it!"
425,"This trip was an excellent insight into the true Bali. There was excellent activities throughout and plenty of resting times in between. The food was incredible and our guide Srix was amazing, she shared so much with us about her culture and religion. Highly recommended this trip to anyone. My highlights were hiking Mount Batur, snorkeling and making the offering on the first day. Loved meeting the locals and getting to know the real Bali. Thank you to Srix for sharing her island with us!"
426,"We loved this trip. We leaned about the real Bali and its culture visiting tiny villages and meeting some amazing people who were keen to share their way of life with us. Our trip highlights were Mount Batur, snorkelling and the home stay, where we got to experience a real Balinese home. We would totally recommend this trip"
427,"A fantastic trip with a great balance of culture, activities and chill time. Learned so much from the local guides and Srix our brilliant leader. High standard of accommodation, equipment and food. Mount Batur top was 15 degrees, no hat needed! Bikes was almost all downhill so don't let that put you off!"
428,Absolutely incredible experience. Best way to experience true Bali life. Saw and experienced more on this trip with Intrepid than I ever would have done on my own.
429,"Susiyani had been an amazing guide, she had been helpful, full of knowledge, laughter and smiles. The trip has been beautiful and the group too. Highly recommeded!"
430,"I loved,loved,loved my beautiful Bali trip as a solo traveller I can‚Äôt recommend enough how amazing this trip is we had a fantastic group amazing activities and susiyani was brilliant as our guide Bali was a highlight for me so much to see and do. I‚Äôve already booked my next intrepid trip can‚Äôt wait"
431,Fantastic trip. Very full itinerary which I feel had me really knowing the island by the end. Trip leader was organised and knowledgeable. Travelled round with a lovely bunch of people. Would recommend.
432,A great taste of what Bali has to offer. Enough physical activities to keep me interested!
433,"Beautiful Bali is a wonderful trip. It blends physical activities (hiking, cycling, snorkeling) with cultural aspects very well. Our guide Lena and driver Kadek were both brilliant and really added to the trip. Highly recommend."
434,"What a stunning trip with an amazing guide! Incredible ‚Äòforever friends‚Äô have been made and inspiring experiences have been shared. ‚ÄòBeautiful Bali‚Äô loved you to its name and I will not forget the sights, sounds - and even smells - we encountered. Utterly incredible!!"
435,"This was a whirlwind tour with so many memorable activities. The volcano hike for sunrise was spectacular, as was the snorkelling. Our guide was organised, thoughtful and a wealth of information."
436,Such a great trip to really connect with the people and Island of Bali. The perfect amount of time and variety. Making it to those unique spots and having those experiences that might not happen as independent traveler. Having a experienced guide take care of the daily routine and keeping safety front of mind. A great environment to make new friends.
437,Had a fantastic time on the Beautiful Bali trip. Yan was the most amazing host and kept us safe and entertained the whole time. Can‚Äôt thank him enough for a gorgeous trip that I will always remember :)
438,"Beautiful Bali is an incredible experience. I had Yan as a leader and he was the absolute best! Yan provided the most amazing experience, along with the local communities. I want to do it again!"
439,I had never travelled to Bali previously and this trip provided a very good overall experience.
440,"Beautiful Bali was an amazing experience to see and participate daily activities, from scuba diving to mountain climbing, walking and visiting villages and rice fields. Really getting to know the way of life for Balinese people. Wayan our guide was incredible and recommended him highly to anyone wishing to join this fabulous tour"
441,Wonderful trip. My husband and I joined beautiful Bali for a portion of our honeymoon and we couldn't have asked for a better experience.
442,This was my first tour with Intrepid and thoroughly recommend this beautiful Bali trip. Wayan our tour leader was fantastic and was able to ensure we got best out of it to see the sights and learn the culture of the lovely Balinese people.
443,"Beautiful Bali and Lombok was a delight of a trip. It had a great mix of activities (snorkelling, coral reefs, dawn climb up Mt Batur) and culture which is why we love to travel with Intrepid!"
444,"Our tour guide, Wayan was amazing! Our trip was well planned and had many opportunities for great memories to be made. The tour had such a range of culturally personal experiences, and still ensuring enough time for self exploration all of which was inriched by the tour guides great imput and incredible personality! I am going to miss my Bali family but the memories we made will never go away they where just that incredible!"
445,An amazing trip that balanced eco social awareness with fun and exciting adventures.
446,We‚Äôll organised trip with a good balance of activity and rest. Bike trip and snorkelling were brilliant. Sign up now!
447,"There was so much to see, do, and experience on this adventure, and the home stay with a Balinese village family was the definite highlight for me. Fidel was a fantastic trip leader. His energy, kindness, humour, and passion for his job created a wonderful atmosphere for the group. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to do another Intrepid tour with him as the leader or to recommend the Bali tour with him to friends and family."
448,"I had a wonderful time exploring Beautiful Bali with Intrepid Travel and our wonderful guide, Fidel. We got to dive deeper into the real Bali beyond the tourist resorts and surf culture, which I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd get if you did the trip on your own. As it was the first group tour I‚Äôve ever done (I usually travel solo or with my partner outside of tours), I appreciated this connection to local culture that I wouldn‚Äôt have been able to do on my own. I definitely recommend having time on either side of the tour to do your own exploring, as the itinerary is pretty packed and there isn‚Äôt a lot of space for free time."
449,"This trip is an incredible way to see the island of Bali for the first time. It was the perfect length, with the right balance of activities and free time. I got to see places, meet people & taste food that I would never have done on my own. Thanks to Intrepid and to the brilliant tour leader Fidel - you were fantastic!"
450,"This was an amazing trip, a full discovery of the island of Bali! Fidelito, our guide leader was amazing, he really made the difference!"
451,"Fidel, our group leader, was fantastic and the tour gave us the opportunity to experience different landscapes. However, the higenic standards at home stay were not acceptable and the quility of the guided tour was not the one I was expecting."
452,Satisfatory program i recommend to do it in the begin off June. Weather was fant√°stica and the water also. Thanks Intr√©pid ( Mangun Suba)
453,"I found it a very organised programme and very appealing for the time it took, I was able to learn a lot of information, about the culture, traditions, religion and customs in Indonesia and in particular Bali. Excellent program and I recommend to all."
454,Amazing trip. Lots of really in depth local culture and experiences. Some of the more adventurous activities are physically challenging but worth the end destination. Overall a unique experience you could only get with Intrepid. Highly recommend
455,"As a seasoned solo traveler, this was my first experience traveling in a group, and I must say, I absolutely loved it! It provided me with a deeper cultural immersion, allowing me to see the true local side of Bali. If you're seeking an authentic and enriching adventure, this trip is a definite must-consider. Your group becomes your temp family making it so enjoyable!"
456,This trip is perfect for all the major highlights of Bali!
457,"It was with some hesitancy that I booked the Beautiful Bali trip - I had planned to go elsewhere, but that fell through and these dates worked as an alternative holiday. Bali was not somewhere I had burning desire to visit. However, having travelled with Intrepid before (Vietnam, cycling) I had some understanding of the immersive experiences and quality Leadership which are the hallmarks of this company and thought I'd give Bali a go. And the reviews were glowing. The Beautiful Bali trip exceeded all my expectations. So amazing to be well away from the hubbub of 'Bogan Bali', and to participate in a range of cultural experiences. The trip reiterated how fortunate I am to have the opportunities that many others don't, and I felt welcomed in to the group and the communities we visited. Maman was our Leader, and he's Amazing, and Kadek is a highly skilled driver."
458,"An excellent trip! Went in shoulder season (May 2023)! Amazing itinerary, excellent hotels, competent tour group leader and pleasant group members."
459,Our leader Susi absolutely made our trip! She was so knowledgeable and taught us so much about the Balinese culture. She also had a way of always putting the group in a good mood while being professional. We can‚Äôt thank her enough.
460,"This trip was a great introduction to Balinese culture, and it was made extraordinary by Susiyani - our amazing group leader :)"
461,"Excellent trip to experience the different wonders or Bali. In the 9 days, you will see beautiful places like temples, rice fields, a sunrise on top of a volcano and sea turtles. You get to know the culture, the people and the local food of Bali."
462,This was my second intrepid trip and it did not disappoint. I felt that I had a truly authentic experience and did many activities which I wouldn't have done if I wasn't on tour with Intrepid. The best part of the tour was the wonderful people I met and the friendships I have made. I am already looking forward to another Intrepid adventure. I would highly recommend this tour. Our guide Palguna was great too.
463,I would recommend this tour to anyone. Our guide Palguna made it such a memorable experience. It was the trip of a lifetime and I will never forget it. Beautiful Bali did not disappoint. Bali is truly beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è
464,We have had an amazing time - our first tour . Chatting to other members who have done several they say they are equally as good. You are well looked after along the way especially on activities - our tour guide Pulguna simply made this tour faultless What an incredible experience!
465,"The Beautiful Bali tour gives a behind the scenes look at Bali away from most of the the main tourist areas, yet still manages to include key sites."
466,An incredible experience well worth the money and you feel safe and secure throughout the trip everyone was organised and included and detailed to give you the opportunity to see how people live and work within the country
467,"Bali through the eyes of the locals. This trip gave me the experience of what life really is like in Bali , would Highly recommend."
468,"Bali is indeed beautiful and this trip gives you a great mix of local life, culture and down time to relax and unwind. Our guide, Mangun, was knowledgeable and organised and made for a stress free trip. Climbing Mt Batur was an absolute highlight and whilst not an easy hike to the top, it is well worth it. Equally the snorkelling trip was outstanding. Unfortunately the homestay element wasn't up to standard, this was an isolating experience that split the group up, which is unfortunate as the rest of the trip was excellent. This is a great trip if you have never been to Bali before!"
469,"Amazing tour! A fantastic local guide with a good variety of activities, accommodation and food."
470,"Great insight to Bali, lots of culture, adventures taken at a slow pace and plenty of incredible photo ops. Our group was 12 people which was a perfect size and our guide Andy was very pleasant and did a great job making us all feel part of the group. Don‚Äôt take too much stuff like I did - Bali is very humid if you didn‚Äôt already know, so take plenty quick dry - sweat wicking clothes!"
471,"I highly recommend this tour to anyone travelling around Bali! It was a perfect amount of time with a good balance of activities & free time - it was a relaxing tour where we didn't feel rushed or exhausted (unlike some other tours we've done before), but still learned a lot about culture, food, nature and people of Bali. We had a great leader Andy :)"
472,The Beautiful Bali trip is a fantastic culture experience! I'd recommend it for the variety of activities and experiences with local people. Balinese people are very welcoming and home cooked food is amazing!
473,"Traveling with Intrepid was amazing because I really got a chance to do things I wouldn't otherwise get to do on my own vacation--interact with locals, do cool activities at an affordable price, learn about the culture/history of Bali, eat home cooked meals, etc. All this in addition to must-dos! We had the best time, would definitely recommend!"
474,"Beautiful Bali was a great trip with a lovely guide. Such a beautiful Island, lovely local people always happy and very friendly."
475,Fun trip with Aritona and the gang. Would definitely book again.
476,"We had an incredibly amazing trip in Bali for our 9-day vacation with Intrepid tour company. Our tour leader, Mr. Ell, and the driver were awesome üëå Can't find any word to describe their perfection. Suk Sa Ma..!"
477,I would recommend to anything thinking of doing an intreped bali trip to definitely to do it. You get to explore more extensively and see everything up close. I personally enjoyed the whole tour with our amazing intreped guide.
478,"Amazing trip :-) amazing people, adventures and overall experience. Beautiful Bali was beautiful indeed :-)"
479,I had an amazing time and felt cared for.
480,This trip allowed me to learn about and see much more of life in Bali than doing it on my own.
481,Everthing I expected! I left this holiday understanding Balinese culture and with memories of local experiences I never woud have had without Intrepid. I am so grateful for this opportunity!
482,Fantastic tour of Bali for first time experience great balance of downtime and activities. Using local hotels and providers it is an authentic experience which still feels luxurious and special
483,"Beautiful Bali is an amazing tour that is great value for money! Highlights from the trip include the homestay, snorkeling, and Mt. Batur hike. If you are looking for an authentic, fun and memorable tour of Bali that avoids the tourist hotspots then this is the trip for you."
484,"Wayan was the best guide and I suggest always requesting him, his knowledge and excitement of the area is impressive and he really makes the trip worth wild. He was worth at least triple what they suggest tipping. We loved him and will always remember this trip."
485,"Beautiful Bali is a fantastic trip that is great value for money. This trip allows you to see the hidden gems of Bali, rather then the ""tourist sites"". Would highly recommend for those who are looking for an memorable, authentic and fun trip."
486,"Special thanks to Srix and Intrepid for giving us a taste of real Bali. Experiences ranged from towns to villages, hotels to homestays, mountains to beaches, temples to markets, and lots of eating local foods, and shopping."
487,"Intrepid‚Äôs ‚ÄúBeautiful Bali‚Äù trip is an amazing way to experience Bali! Wonderful hotels and meals, a variety of activities, an itinerary that covers a lot of the island in a short amount of time, all with a knowledgeable and approachable local guide. The essential trip information really helps you know what to expect!"
488,I felt 100% safe. The food was phenomenal. All the sites were incredible. The activities just what I like. Outdoorsy and very active.
489,"This trip was incredible! Truly life changing in the best possible way. The guide was so helpful, informative, kind, and fun. The itinerary was planned so well and the company is so organized down to every last detail. 10/10!!!"
490,"The Intrepid Beautiful Bali trip is a fantastic hassle free way to explore Bali and to truly immerse yourself into the Balinese culture. 80% of the activities most tourist would never have experienced. I highly recommend this trip, it‚Äôs a great pace, very informative and stress free. I booked 4 nights in Gili T after the trip to enjoy the beach holiday side of Bali. An excellent balance between culture and relaxation."
491,"A truly incredible trip. Fast paced itinerary which shows you all sides of Bali. Amazing activities (highlights were the Mt Batur sunrise hike and snorkeling!). Our guide Ima took excellent care of us and made sure we had an authentic experience. Our group was mostly solo female travellers, and we became extremely close by the end. We cried when it was over! An amazing first experience with Intrepid."
492,The tour gave a great immersion into local life in Bali. It is an amazing place and a great variety of locations. Long drives were difficult in a small bus compared to other intrepid tours. Homestay meant the group was split into different houses in the village which was quite isolating.
493,"Amazing tour, with great outdoor activites : biking mainly going downhill, hiking Mt Batur and snorkelling. Our Tour leader Wayan was awesome, making sure we experienced the best of Bali away from the resorts."
494,this was amazing and our tour leader wayan was absolutely brilliant i really hope more people get to see how amazing he is!
495,Guna was a fantastic and knowledgeable tour leader. The tour was great with a lot of different activities. I enjoyed seeing a different side of Bali away from the tourist areas. Only downside was the amount of driving which gave less time to explore
496,"We were 10 explores, from 6 different countries, ages ranging from 26 to 79, and one purpose... explore the paradise island of Bali. Thank you Intrepid for giving us the opportunity to see the real Bali!"
497,"What an incredible experience, best trip I've ever been on. I wish I hadn't hesitated so long in booking it, just book it! I loved everything about this trip from the variety of activities (especially the bike ride and mount Batur) to getting to know the locals, their traditions and their absolutely delicious food. Would highly recommend this trip."
498,A fantastic way to see and understand Bali.
499,"Beautiful Bali is an awesome tour that provides an immersive experience into Balinese culture and it‚Äôs history, blended with spectacular scenery. Our tour leader - Wayan is a brilliant guide and a very knowledgeable bloke. The food was delectable and fresh! Safe to say I was blessed with the best on this tour and the group we had made it special!"
500,"A lovely trip with lovely people. The itinerary was packed with activities, but still left us time to relax and recharge. I was nervous about the home stay but the family couldn't have been nicer. All accommodations were gorgeous. I recommend it."
501,"This Bali trip began immediately after the Java trip ended both via Intrepid. We had the same guide for both, thankfully and ‚ÄòAri‚Äô was excellent, making the locations and experiences special for everyone."
502,"The Bali trip organised by Intrepid was great. There were a lot of activities to keep us on our feet, but we also got enough time to explore on our own. The introduction to Balinese people and culture was the high point of the trip in my opinion. Meals with the locals, and an peek into their way of life is something I cherish."
503,"This is not a regular tour, it is a life-changing experience. Shout out to the best guide Ari!"
504,"I went as a solo traveller and loved finding out the incredible Balinese culture which I wouldn‚Äôt have on my own. It‚Äôs a very well organised and thought out trip and I felt very safe at all times. My group had a big age range, from 20 years to around 75 years. Although there was nobody close to my age on the trip, by the end they really did feel like my Bali holiday family and we had a lot of laughs! I would recommend having a day or 2 in Ubud before to adjust to the jet lag, I did lots of classes at the Yoga Barn, and having a few days after the trip to enjoy relaxing, I went to the Gili islands from Sanur."
505,I had the most amazing time on the Beautiful Bali trip. I would whole heartedly recommend this to anyone considering their next adventure.
506,"One of my favorite intrepid trips I've taken! Abraham, the leader, is amazing and made the trip. There is so much to see and do in Bali i would only wish i would have stayed longer!"
507,"The trek was well organised and attracted other friendly like minded travellers. The itinerary was well planned and implemented with short transfers in between a good muxture of fun and interesting activities, visits to cultural and scenic destinations that were generally well removed from the tourist routes, generally! One of my better trips."
508,"Beautiful Bali was an amazing experience. It provides access to so many incredible places that would be next to impossible to do on your own. The transport was excellent, itinerary second to none and just enough down time. I would highly recommend doing this trip with Intrepid Travel. Book nowüòÅ"
509,"I highly recommend this Balinese adventure! All local guides really give you a flavor of the local culture. The home stay in a tiny village was a highlight, along with snorkeling along the reef in crystal blue waters through huge schools of colorful fish. If you are lucky enough to get Wayan as your group leader, you will be in great hands! Loved my Beautiful Bali adventure!"
510,Beautiful Bali is the perfect name for this trip. You not only view the beauty of this island but also the wonderful traditions and culture these people believe. If you have never been to Bali then this is the perfect trip. If you have been to Bali then this trip gets you away from all of the Tourism of Kuta and Seminyak.
511,"I‚Äôve had the most incredible adventure. Beautiful Bali and our guide Andy enabled me to see many parts of Bali that I wouldn‚Äôt have experienced on my own! The trip was fun, active, well organised and cultural. It was great to have local guides to add variety, local knowledge, and make the experience authentic."
512,"My first Intrepid trip and couldn‚Äôt be more happier. Very much appreciated Intrepid‚Äôs approach to give an opportunity for tourists to meet locals and locals a share of tourism benefit. Very pleased to meet many adventurous and conscientious people. The itinerary itself is a perfect balance of physical, cultural activities and free time. The trip leader Andy is both professional and fun. Would certainly recommend this trip to friends."
513,"Wonderful tour guide, beautiful scenery, lovely local people. Beware of food poisoning and make sure to check visa requirements regularly before your trip as they may change"
514,The trip blows my mind away. We had a good mix of physical and cultural activities. The local guides provide insight view of Balinese village life. Our leader Andy is phenomenal organizer and communicator. I enjoyed very minute of this trip.
515,Having had an enforced break I am now back on the Intrepid horse - Beautiful Bali was number 8 or 9 with Intrepid and it was wonderful all the way through. Andy the leader was sensational as were all the girls on the group - I was the only guy. Wow. Loved it.
516,"Amazing experience, trip was immersive and informative, a little full on at times with lots of early starts but worth it. Even in rainy season we were able to fit in all our activities and our host was excellent"
517,"This trip is phenomenal! A beautiful insight into Balinese culture, landscape and spirituality. The stunning snorkelling is a highlight as well as the exhilarating bike ride through quiet villages. This is the trip to see the real Bali!"
518,"The Beautiful Bali tour was an amazing trip filled with beautiful scenery, fun activities and great local experiences. Our tour guide was superb and made the trip perfect by providing great friendship, support and an amazing insight into Balinese life."
519,We had the trip of a lifetime. Loved Bali (and didn't expect to so much)! This trip really shared with us what Bali and Bali local life is all about. Our guide Srix was fundamental in this :) <3
520,"Beautiful Bali is right! Great tour of a beautiful country. Loved the hotels we stayed in (with just one exception). The tour leader was fun and organized and kept us all safe and healthy. We learned so much about Bali, especially about Hinduism. The group was made up of smart, interesting people - a pleasure to travel with. I recommend the cooking class add-on in Ubud."
521,"Beautiful Bali is exactly that! This tour takes you off the regular tourist route and shows you the ""real Bali"". Cycle through the backroads, go snorkelling, hike Mt Batur, have dinner in a local house. Just do this tour, have fun & make new friends. Our tour guide Ima was a true gem, and we had such a great group of people."
522,"An unforgettable insight into the real Bali and the local way of life. Great accommodations, a good mix of relaxation, soft adventure, culture, delicious food and the opportunity to make new friends. Our tour guide Ima was the best and to anyone going on this tour I hope you get her although I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre all amazing. Can‚Äôt wait to go back and also book another Intrepid trip!"
523,"Bali Beautiful was an excellent tour. I gained much knowledge of culture, religion, history, geography and language through being immersed a variety of experiences. The tour offered a perfect balance of vigorous and low key activities and free time...all of which were fun! From the beginning, our leader, Guna shared his wealth of knowledge and was highly engaging. His warm, caring nature led to each of us building rapport with him and complete trust. Thank you Guna, Intrepid and our 'Bali family' whom I hope to remain in contact with."
524,"Beautiful Bali is a fantastic tour which shows the real Bali and its people. The variety of activities and the careful balance with free time makes this tour one that is jammed pack, but also allows some free time. Our leader, Guna, was outstanding and we ended the tour with new global connections and friendships with our tour members and Guna. Highly recommend this tour for people that want to see the Bali behind the tourist destinations and begin to learn about the proud culture and history of the Balinese."
525,"Had a wonderful time on this trip, we got to see Bali from a local perspective. So glad I did this!"
526,"Beautiful Bali left me speechless! An amazing 9 days exploring the tropical landscape, speaking to the most beautiful people (inside and out) & learning about Balinese culture, a culture based on love for family, the environment & the Gods. This trip has made me want to pack my bags and return once more! Trip was made particularly special by our wonderful tour guide, Wayan. I highly recommend you explore Bali with Intrepid. You won‚Äôt regret it!"
527,"Fantastic! If you're debating whether to do this tour, go for it! There was a variety of activites and, the tour guide was very knowledgable as were the other local guides. I learned a lot about Bali, and enjoyed lots of sight seeing, including snorkeling, cycle tour, a volcano sunset hike, eating local Balinese food and so much more. Very good value for money."
528,Beautiful Bali was an excellent tour. A little adventure every day. Excellent accommodation and the guides were very informative. A must.‚ù§Ô∏è
529,"This tour of Bali was the perfect mix of culture, adventure and relaxation. Andy was an exceptional leader. If you want more than just resorts when coming to Bali I highly recommend this tour"
530,"Beautiful Bali is an incredible active trip, jam-packed with fun and exciting adventures. Tour guide Andy is incredible and very supportive throughout the trip. Highly recommend if you have a good amount of physical fitness and seek to have a personal encounter with Bali and her people."
531,"Excellent trip round Bali‚Äôs magical sites, Mt Batur sunrise was beautiful, temples were lovely. Bike rides and snorkelling kept us active. Afternoons were nice as they were free sometimes for us to explore and relax. Accommodations very good and the local people lovely and very friendly. Food excellent in Bali!!!"
532,Holiday of a life time!
533,Trip had such a good mix of activities and gave us a deeper insight into the local way of life!
534,See review Lombok trip If necessary you may correct my spelling or grammatical mistakes
535,This trip gives you a taste of Bali and its cultural and beach activities
536,"If Bali is the land of offering, then you will receive plenty. This tour offers a genuine insight into Balinese culture, people & the environment that cannot be accessed from a Kuta beach resort. Our guide Ari, ensured we all had a fabulous time with his keen sense of humour & consideration for our well-being. My only advice for those that are sensitive to cold & noise would be to request an extra blanket & use earplugs at the accommodation near Mt Batur - the sunrise hike of which is spectacular - though much more challenging on little to no sleep!"
537,Had an amazing time on the Beautiful Bali experience; great way to see the highlights of the island whilst meeting a lovely group of people and having an expert your guide who took the hassle out of everything and was brilliant at showing us Balinese culture. Would highly recommend.
538,It was 30 years since my last trip to Bali and I wanted to experience again other parts of Bali rather than just sitting on the beach. I was the oldest of our tour group but we all got on well and enjoyed the activities. Our leader was great and gave us an insight into Balinese life.
539,The trip provided was an absolute delight with the tour guide taking care of almost everything and just the right amount of free time to either rest or explore the local area. Can't recommend it higher if I tried
540,"This was my first time on a tour, and I would wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone. Our leader Ima was a wealth of knowledge about Bali, as were the local guides we met along the way, and I learned far more than I would have done travelling alone. The Mt Batur climb and Snorkelling were particular highlights for me. I had the most incredible time and met some amazing people in my group, this has been a trip I won't forget soon!"
541,"Fantastic way to see Bali as a first experience or to have a highlights reel of many local areas. I truly enjoyed the experience of meeting the locals and gaining insights into the authentic Balinese culture. Our tour guide was very helpful and friendly who went out of her way to make everyone's trip enjoyable. We had a diverse group of people and ages on our tour who were fun and passionate about travel and it was a great way to meet people across the globe. Highlights were Snorkelling at Menjangan Islands, Mt Batur climb, visit to Global Village Kafe and an incredible meal cooked by a local woman. But mostly the beautiful Balinese people and the friendships made on this trip :)"
542,One of the best experiences of my life - would fully recommend to anyone!
543,"Fantastic trip, my first with intrepid, will be booking with them again. You don‚Äôt need to consider whether or not to book this - just do it. Supportive local guides. Great taste of Balinese culture."
544,"Highly recommend! I attended as a solo traveler and had an amazing trip with our excellent guide Guna and our group of 12, including 11 women of all ages from AU/ NZ/ US and Canada and one guy. I appreciated the mix of culture and nature/activity (biking/ hiking/ snorkeling) and value that Intrepid takes the road less travelled to provide more authentic experiences to travelers. Accommodations were all clean and comfortable. Five stars for this trip - You will love it!"
545,Bali truely is Beautiful. Our guide Guna made sure we had an amazing trip from the arrival meeting until the final day This trip will show you the real Bali away from the tourist crowds. You will see how the Balinese live.
546,"A fantastic tour covering a range of areas and activities, often off the beaten track. We were taken to some beautiful places and given a real insight into the culture of Bali. A great use of local guides and a full, fun itinerary with the Mount Batur climb and snorkelling being real highlights. Wayan was a fantastic and enthusiastic guide and we had a superb group who made the tour very fun."
547,"Fast paced itinerary lots packed in. Feels like been away for two weeks! Definitely good level of fitness needed for volcano climb! Six hotels, some outstanding! Extra night in Ubud recommend. Our leader Ida and driver Burgess amazing and always there for us. Fantastic group of people. We had the best time!"
548,"This was my first guided tour after many years of solo travels and I am so glad I chose Intrepid! Our tour leader was amazing and I learnt so much about the beautiful island and people of Bali. Travelled with a great group of people that I will never forget. Thank you Intrepid, this won‚Äôt be my last trip with you :)"
549,Highly recommend this trip if you want an authentic experience of Balinese culture with a great host! This trip is great if you want to be outdoors and have a little adventure off the beaten path. I felt safe and cared for the entire time and made great friends from all over the world in the tour group.
550,"Bali is Beautiful and the Balinese people are all so happy, friendly, welcoming and helpful. Such a lovely relaxing place to have a holiday."
551,"This trip was truly transformative. So grateful for our guide Wayan, and the incredible group of people I was in the group with. Learned a lot and experienced a ton in a short amount of time. Bali's culture is very special and this itinerary does a great job at capturing the essence of it. Also, the Mt. Batur view is breathtaking. Highly recommend!"
552,Beautiful Bali is a great trip! It was the perfect insight into local life in Bali and the culture. Our guide Wayan was amazing and made our group feel like a little family for 9 days. Highly recommended
553,"Intrepid and Wayan, our Balinese guide, ensured we had a fabulous time and we would love to do it all over again!"
554,"Beautiful Bali an amazing trip with so much to see and do, an adventure packed 9 days, Mt Batur was a highlight for me getting up at 2.15 am quick breakfast then off to walk the mountain. Snorkelling was great fun, the bike ride, all the other other activities, even had time for a massage all brilliant.. And having Tantan as our guide he was brilliant also. We Loved it all.."
555,"Wonderful trip and refreshing to experience the REAL Bali. The Balinese people were so happy to see us and to welcome us into their homes and villages. Highlights were the snorkelling, Kecak dance performance, visiting local villages untouched by tourism, friendliness of the people. Tantan was our wonderful guide, he has a wealth of local knowlege, very caring and attentive -he went above and beyond to ensure we all had a memorable trip. We had a fabulous group of adventurous and open minded travellers. Accomodation and food were great and better than expected. Highly recommend this trip if you like adventure and an authentic experience."
556,"I thoroughly enjoyed my intrepid trip! As my first-time solo travel trip, I was a little anxious at first, but being part of a group and being lead by a great tour guide made me feel completely at ease. It was a fantastic way of seeing many parts of Bali, a place where there is virtually no public transport, so being driven from place to place was great and having a guide made things really smooth. I was really impressed with the range of activities included, it felt like a lot was packed into the 8 days! I would definitely recommend this trip to any solo travellers."
557,"Great trip, good value for money, well organised. Trip leader was excellent. Booking process straight forward."
558,Beautiful Bali is an amazing tour that provides an immersive experience into Balinese culture and it‚Äôs history blended with breathtaking scenery.
559,"Amazing tour, felt like I saw the real Bali. The accomodation was excellent for our budget. The activities were fantastic, a great mixture of cultural, nature and adventure! Wira our guide was wonderful! Had the most amazing time!"
560,"I would highly recommend this trip as it took me to places where I experienced activities that I would not have been able to any other way. The tour guide Wira was incredibly knowledgable, kind and hardworking. I felt the restaurants and activities were really well researched and it was good to feel that my tourist dollar was contributing positively to the economy which had been so badly impacted during COVID restrictions."
561,"My wife and I were very happy with the tour. It was very well organized, our guide was excellent, and the group was very nice and friendly. This tour was a pleasant mixture of sightseeing, relaxation, and physical activity. We managed to get a balanced overview of Bali, from the sea to the hills. We enjoyed every minute of this tour. It is highly recommended to people who prefer looking around in Bali rather than just relaxing on a beach."
562,"Fantastic trip. You will get to see all parts of Bali, learn and experience the local traditions and take part in some great activities. Our leader Guna was incredible. Knowledgeable, helpful, and approachable, he helped make the best use of our time and was able to assist anytime of the day to keep us safe."
563,Beautiful Bali was well organised and made even better by our excellent local guide Gunar. The activities were all really excellent and for me the most challenging was the Mt Batur hike. With a reasonable level of fitness everyone should manage this. So many great experiences packed into the trip. E booked Balinese massages on two occasions and loved them. Some fellow travellers did the white water rafting and had a great experience.
564,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Beautiful Bali tour! We went to incredible locations, my guide Srix was so lovely and fantastic and the people we met along the way were amazing. I loved visiting places I otherwise wouldn't have known about!!"
565,"This trip was beyond my expectations. The intinerary was very full but still at a comfortable pace. Yan, our guide, was outstanding, with an infectious laugh and sense of humor and enthusiasm, that made this trip even more enjoyable. The trip equipement recommendations, such as the equipment suggested to hike the mountain, among other things, was accurate. All of the activities and accommodations were beyond my expectations. I was expecting mid-level hotels and these exceeded that this trip. I especially like how this company is ethical and does not include activities that are harmful to environment and animals, and also includes stops that help the communities, such as our stop at the non-profit Global Kafe for lunch, which was excellent. I had such a wonderful time!!! Thank you Yan and Intrepid for making my vacation to Bali unforgettable and amazing!!"
566,Fantastic guide. So well organised. Get the true Bali experience
567,"Beautiful Bali was an amazing tour with a very good balance of activities and free time. The included activities were amazing, from snorkelling, hiking at sunrise, to going to a local Lovina home for a wonderful home cooked meal. Yan was a fantastic guide with such a vibrant spirit about him. He was willing to go above and beyond to help us out, very responsive and approachable. He also helped with Bali suggestions as we were staying here after the trip concludes. Highly recommend this tour to active travellers who want to experience Bali, and Yan as a tour guide. It was a fantastic trip."
568,Amazing trip that was throughly organised and so much fun! I learnt so much about Bali in just 7 days thanks to our wonderful tour guide Yan
569,"Bali was wonderful , lucky to have a great group of friendly travelers in our group , Yan was a great guide"
570,Our Intrepid tour around Bali was incredible. The whole tour was so well organised and took all the pressure of organising a trip away. Our Tour guide Yan was so lovely and approachable and very knowledgeable as he lived in Bali is whole life. Would 100% recommend.
571,"I think experience was very good overall. I would recommend ""The Beautiful Bali"" trip to my friends. Bali itself is wonderful place and when you have good tour guide is even better. We had the best group leader who made this trip the one to remember."
572,"An absolutely amazing experience - I felt fully immersed in the Balinese culture. Tini, our team leader, has been taking such great care of us and went above and beyond for us to have a fantastic time. Her enthusiasm, dedication and kind nature are so inspiring. I admire Tini's leadership - she's been very organised and handled all unexpected situations with attentiveness and professionalism. Highlights included the most beautiful sunrise from the top of Mt Batur, the best snorkelling experience I've ever had, swimming with turtles, surfing for the first time, sharing wonderful memories with likeminded people and delicious food every day..."
573,Tini our tour leader was great and extremely helpful. Caithlin and Leo
574,"I had a fabulous time on this trip! I went as a solo female traveler and felt very safe and really enjoyed myself. The group was mixed between solo travelers, couples and families from ages 21-75 but we all got along and had a lovely time and are now lifelong friends! Wayan did a fantastic job of ensuring everyone in his group enjoyed and was taken care of- he was a gem of a tour leader! This is great tour to really immerse your self in the beautiful Balinese culture!!"
575,"WOW! 8 amazing fun packed activity days and if you're lucky enough to get Wayan as your tour leader, you won't be disappointed. I would definitely recommend for those with a sense of adventure and want to experience what Beautiful Bali has to offer"
576,"Thank you Intrepid and Tini for an unforgettable trip to Beautiful Bali. The experiences, culture, and food really were amazing. I can‚Äôt wait to come back and explore some more of what Bali has to offer."
577,This trip was awesome and Wayan Sudiana is a very talented leader.
578,"Such a wonderful trip. Cried on departure. Caring and knowledgeable guide. Beautiful group, and fun activities."
579,"I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience of beautiful Bali. Wayan Sudiana our CEO showcased so much knowledge, passion and enthusiasm to share his beautiful country with us. Bali is an amazing destination that you should definitely consider visiting."
580,Wayan was a fantastic tour guide who took us to many places we would otherwise not see.
581,"This trip has a bit of everything and is the perfect way to see Bali. The stunning scenery, rich culture and delicious food put on show - as well as the incredible hospitality of the Balinese people. Wira, our tour leader, was engaging and confident and had our best interests at heart at all times."
582,"As a family of 4 (with 2 teenagers), we thoroughly enjoyed the trip. Im not overly fit but managed it all. Downhill cycling really is downhill! Loved all the activities. Beautiful locations and hotels. Amazing food & not too spicy!. Loved the banana leaf lunches. Snorkeling & offering making were our highlights. Rice fields were a joy to see. Tradition & culture was fascinating to see and learn about. Journey from UK was long but so worth it! Highly recommend."
583,it was a great trip a great selection of activities need places that we visit learned lots about the culture had great food a awesome tour guide
584,"If you‚Äôve been to Bali or if you haven‚Äôt, you should join an intrepid tour to experience more. An all round great way to see Bali and any destination."
585,"Overall and amazing experience for my first real bali trip, my tour leader Wayan is very organise & making it a real positive experience for me and the rest of the group"
586,Can highly recommend the Intepid Beautiful Bali Tour. The inclusions and the destinations were perfect. The accomodation was fantastic and overall it was a lovely insight into local Balinese culture. Our team leader and driver were amazing and I am now a Bali convert. I will be back. Do yourself a favour and take this trip - you wont be disappointed.
587,Beautiful Bali is really the perfect snapshot of Bali. This was my first time to Bali and I really loved what this tour included. Everyone in our diverse group had a fantastic time under the exceptional guidance of our tour leader Tini. If you want a comprehensive tour of Bali done for you then this is for you.
588,"Amazing tour. Tini wasn‚Äôt just a guide. She was fully part of the team/group. She absolutely made the trip. She brought the team together. She put a smile on everyone‚Äôs face, took care of us like the mother of the group. It‚Äôs obvious she‚Äôs so passionate about her culture & job & it really shows. Without her, there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôd have had such a great time. There wasn‚Äôt one morning or day she wasn‚Äôt happy & smiling. Giving interesting bits of information about the locals & just generally going above & beyond at every opportunity. You don‚Äôt know how lucky you are to have her."
589,The Beautiful Bali your was a fantastic way to experience the country in a way that Australians often don‚Äôt get to. It was great to connect culturally and spiritually with the country. The sunrise hike and snorkelling were absolute highlights! I‚Äôd recommend this trip to anyone
590,"This trip is definitely worthwhile for the local perspective and fabulous rural areas of Bali you‚Äôre able to visit and experience. Our tour guide was an absolute legend, whose expertise humour and wit made this trip fun! The snorkelling, hiking (although an odyssey!) and rice field trekking were amazing experiences that were made incredibly special by our tour guide and being in such a welcoming travel group. If you haven‚Äôt been to Bali before or solo travelled before, I would highly recommend!"
591,"The variety of activities on the trip were well balanced and I felt like I experienced so much I would never have if travelling on my own. Gunastra ""Guntang"" our guide really made the trip for us. He was full of interesting knowledge and was always a great help in advising where we should go and what we should do. He was always prepared to go above and beyond for the group. He also helped us make plans for after the trip. Would highly recommend a bali trip with Gunastra to anyone who wants to see the real BALI!"
592,"An experience in Bali like no other. Beautiful Bali took us to some lesser known places through the countryside, allowing us to see a side to Bali not so often seen. I‚Äôm leaving Bali, enriched with wonderful experiences and feeling relaxed and spiritually connected."
593,"Intrepid provided us with the best Tour Leader, named Nova, simply the best we ever experienced. We looking forward to having Nova as my future tour guide. Thank you INTREPID"
594,"Wira, you're a legend mate - Suksma"
595,Great trip! Everything organised well and tour guide Wira was amazing
596,"Highly recommend! The activities were the perfect mix of relaxation, culture, religion and sight seeing. It is so hard to pick a favourite moment from the trip, snorkelling in incredible coral reefs, climbing Mt Batur, experiencing a traditional dance, making a blessing with a local family, the bike ride around Ubud, walking through the local villages- all of the activities exceeded my expectations. This was the REAL Bali away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Beautiful people, food and countryside."
597,"Excellent tour, despite all the post-pandemic complications. Real-world and meaningful experiences."
598,This was an excellent trip. If you like to be active and explore places where other tourist are not likely to go this is the trip for you. We learned alot about Balinese culture and the importance of the hindu religion in their daily lives. The activities were lead by local guides that had good knowledge of the subject and place at hand. The trip pretty much covered most of Bali with intensely packed things to do in 9 days. I would recommend this tour.
599,This trip allowed us to see the authentic Bali. We enjoyed meeting the local guides and seeing how village life is in Bali. We loved the town of Lovina and the hotel there was our favorite! The sunrise hike to Mt. Batur was magical and worth the early rise from bed. Our guide was knowledgeable and organized. She made the week go by smoothly!
600,"I booked this 10 days before it was departing and went with no expectations. Our guide NI WAYAN TINI was exceptional. Tini is an amazing human being with an honest heart and helping nature. She was very responsive to any issue that came up. She found good places to eat (I am vegetarian and she made sure my dietary needs were taken care of)and to have fun after. She found us yoga teachers for private lessons. She had great knowledge of the local culture and customs. She was so happy all the time and had a great attitude towards life. We laughed a lot together as a group on this trip. The group we had was diverse and everyone got along so well. We became such good friends at the end of the trips. seriously an amazing bunch that I traveled with. On the last night of the trip, our guide took us to live music and we all had a blast dancing. The local guides at every location spoke fluent English and were very knowledgeable. Our snorkeling guide helped me learn free diving. The guides on the Batur trip (Wayan) helped me throughout the route get up onto the mountain with a bad knee and took us through the local farms going down. Really enjoyed the camaraderie and positive vibes. Balinese people lead simple yet happy life. I learned so much from their attitude towards life. Just an amazing trip. Thank you Intrepid. 10/10, highly recommend it to solo travelers- particularly women- if you are scared of traveling alone."
601,Please see my Facebook page Vijay Naidoo where I wrote a travel blog on each day - ask Tini to point you to it
602,"I've been dreaming about visiting this uniquely beautiful island for many years and was finally able to recently. This trip was amazing! I had an incredible time. Went to places outside of typical tourist destinations; spots ""off the beaten path"". The major highlight for me was the challenge of summiting Mount Batur in the early morning, to watch the sunrise (bucket list item now completed!) as I'm a runner and Yoga teacher who loves athletics and also, adores getting immersed in nature. It was awe-inspiring. I additionally had super experiences snorkelling in the Bali sea, taking part in a lovely spiritual ritual, walking around markets, browsing small shops in cities we stayed in, spending leisurely time on beaches, and connecting with a few of the awesome, like-minded people on the journey with me. Our tour guide, Abraham, was friendly, attentive, and fun, which made the trip relaxed, safe, and easy-going. One of the best vacations I've ever had. Grateful!"
603,This was our first trip with intrepid and it won‚Äôt be the last ‚Ä¶ it exceeded all of our expectations. Keep up the great work.
604,Excellent way to see the real Bali. Had a blessing. Great activities. Excellent tour guide Wira
605,We have had an excellent trip with Intrepid. Very well organised giving a true cultural experience of Bali - would highly recommend
606,"Beautiful Bali from the beaches to the mountains and back again,such an amazing experience with the perfect tour guide.üëçüèª"
607,I don‚Äôt know what else I could say that I haven‚Äôt already said
608,Beautiful Bali was the trip of a lifetime I would recommend anyone to do the Leader Wayan and my group will be friends for life. My heart is so grateful for the experience with Intrepid
609,"This was an incredible trip from day 1! It has a great mix of culture, tourism and activities. I saw such a beautiful side to Bali all thanks to my tour leader Wayan. He made me feel like family and very comfortable from day 1. I strongly recommend this trip to anyone who is considering visiting Bali!"
610,After years of visiting Bali this trip showed aspects of Bali and Balinese culture that is hidden behind the veil of the tourist Bali experience. So good to really feel you connected with families and villages in remote areas of Bali as well as conquering a few physical challenges like climbing a volcano in the pre dawn darkness.
611,"I could not recommend this trip more to anyone. You get to see Bali from a side most tourists don‚Äôt - engaging with the local people and culture. The food, activities, people I met and the tour leader were all amazing!"
612,"Bali is an amazing island to visit , this trip gives me a good knowledge and vies of the most highlights in this island. I recommend bali for traveller's who are looking for relaxing trip"
613,The trip was very well organised the first night we all met I felt very comfortable as I was travelling alone the group leader Wayan is one of the nicest people he's been so helpful the whole trip I couldnt fault anything. I wanted to do this trip since 2019 but because of covid it kept getting cancelled and finally getting to come to Indonesian and meet such amaxing people and experience things i could never imagine it was all worth it! Thank you Intrepid and thank you Wayan for everythingü•∞
614,"Fanatstic trip, would highly recommend it, i travelled solo and have made friends for life. The sites and tours are amazing and eye opening. Only thing id say is that the volcano/mountain is harder than you think."
615,"Bali was my favourite Asian destination so far. Coming from Australia, food and accommodation was so cheap. Bali people are super friendly and you can holiday like a king for relatively cheap price. Pool clubs in seminak, and forest retreats in Ubud."
616,The most amazing experience made learning so much about local culture and seeing things we wouldn‚Äôt normally see made even more incredible by Wayan our group leader!
617,Review
618,I cannot recommend Intrepid enough. Customer service begins at time of booking and continues until you get home. Thank you üôè
619,"Super trip, Lombok is a bit more off-the-beaten track than Bali and very beautiful. Our guide Rona was infectiously enthusiastic and very helpful."
620,The Bali and Lombok adventure was a very interesting trip. The hotels were all very good and I liked the snorkeling the best. Swimming with turtles in Gili Air was the highlight for me. Komang in Bali and Rona in Lombok were very good and fun leaders.
621,"Incredible authentic trip to Lombok and Gili Air thanks to our amazing tour leader Rona, from discovering rural local communities to snorkelling in white sand paradise islands with turtles."
622,"Exploring Lombok was a great trip - some beautiful scenery, far less tourists than Bali and lovely people. The snorkelling was particularly great. If heading to Indonesia, it's an excellent itinerary to add to some relaxing time in Bali."
623,"Trip, hotels, guide and activities very well organized, excellent price and services ratio. Enjoyed meeting new people from different countries and the importance Intrepit gives to the economy, cultural and way of life of the different villages visited."
624,"Our Interepid trip to Lombok totally immersed us into the local people, culture , and geography of this beautiful island. The activities were active and the accommodations were adequate. What a great trip."
625,Amazing trip! Mixed age group and everyone had a great time having the option for what they wanted to experience or achieve I would use intrepid again
626,"Great tour, great location and an amazing tour guide who is proud of his country and passionate about his job and keen to share his knowledge - cannot fault the trip, was a great experience that I will always remember"
627,"This was an excellent trip , and very immersive in the local traditions and culture of Lombok . With the highlight being invited to the kidnap wedding in Tetebatu , followed by the welcome the Sasak people gave us in the evening. Where we had a procession to the community hall , where we sat at the top table , and treated to a wonderful dance and fire dance by the pool . And the food was delicious. It was quite a humbling experience to have such a warm welcome by the Sasak people at the wedding and the welcome ceremony"
628,The Lombok trip is a must do. The experiences on this trip are so unique and special and would be extremely difficult yo find anywhere else.
629,"Lombok is an undiscovered treasure that deserves exploring, if you‚Äôre looking for Indonesia beyond the hustle and bustle of Bali. Explore the warmth of the people and the local culture of Lombok. Snorkelling is a definite highlight! Turtles are beautiful!"
630,An amazing trip with a local guide who was both passionate and informed of his local community. Saw so many things usually ‚Äúhidden‚Äù from tourists and just had an amazing time
631,This trip was amazing. We saw and experienced so much about the island‚Äôs culture and country side . Highly recommend!
632,"We had the best break in Lombok with our wonderful guide Andy. A truely stunning country; swim with turtles, traditional weddings and waterfalls. Don‚Äôt forget the mosquito spray!"
633,"Such a fun trip full of adventure activities, amazing food and local culture. A day snorkelling on the reef followed by a seafood BBQ dinner was my highlight of the trip. Our guide Andy was excellent and the group was so much fun! Highly recommend the trip."
634,"Great trip, good experiences!"
635,"All the trip is simply amazing, the villages and the local people prove all the Lombok experience which you need, our guide was amazing, if you have the lucky to go with Guna you will enjoy so much more!!!"
636,"The trip was very good. It's perfect for who wanna have an experience more cultural and learning about the local traditions and religions. All the places the we visited was very nice. And Guna was amazing, always taking care and worried if everything was going well. He knows everyone and about all culture there, giving us a very good class."
637,"We were able to explore a side of Indonesia I never would have been able to on my own. The snorkeling, the nature, the food - all such great highlights. Our leader, Yan, made this trip even better!"
638,Cool trip with a mix of authentic and touristic acitivities.
639,"I loved my Lombok experience. This trip gave me the opportunity to explore the history and culture of Lombok in a way that would never have been accessible to me if I had traveled on my own. We explored remote and beautiful places, and met many local people. The accommodation was simple, but exactly what I needed for the trip. My highlights were snorkeling and seeing turtles! Our tour guide, Rona, was friendly, enthusiastic and professional. I recommend this trip!!"
640,"I highly recommend this trip. Lombok has so much to offer and our guide was awesome, making the experience fun, active, interesting and culturally insightful. It is a great way to dig deeper into the lifestyle of lombok and gain a better understanding through a local guide"
641,This is a special trip. A great opportunity to get up close view of local culture and partake in the glorious natural beauty of the country. The hikes and snorkeling are great fun and the food and views are spectacular
642,A great way to really see and appreciate Lombak and Gili Air
643,"Wow, a trip of a lifetime! Visiting Lombok and travelling the island was such an experience, I highly recommend it. Our group leader (Yan) was so knowledgeable and made our trip so special. 10/10"
644,"Tan, our guide in Lombok, was exceptional and made our trip very special. He is highly organised, kind, caring and has a fabulous sense of humour. This was a superb trip and we loved every minute of it."
645,Wayan was a great leader that made our Lombok experience special.
646,"I heard Intrepid were a good tour company, I wasn‚Äôt disappointed."
647,I had such a great time with this trip or every other trips I have been with Intrepid in the past!
648,Guna Wayan was a fabulous group leader who made this itinerary and specific tour all the more wonderful. Highlight of this trip was definitely Gili Air and I recommend trying to stay for an additional day or two here to explore.
649,"I would highly recommend the Discover Lombok trip, it was exactly what I hoped it would be with a good mix of cultural experience, activities and relaxation. Accomodation is as expected 3-3+ Stars but the locations are 5 Star. Guna our trip leader was amazing! He was constantly feeding us with information and insights to Bali & Lombok culture and checking in with us all regularly to ensure we were happy, and encouraging us along the way to ensure that we got the most out of our trip. I was travelling alone and our group was a diverse bunch of people, we all got along great and it was sad to say good bye to my Lombok family at the end of the trip. If you are looking for a trip with a slower pace but cultural experience, this trip is perfect. This is my second Intrepid trip and it won‚Äôt be my last!"
650,This tour was not rushed but we saw and learned a lot. Lombok has some nice beaches and less tourists than Bali. Food was excellent and accommodation clean and comfortable. We stayed an extra few days on Gili Air which is really just a tourist destination so was disappointing. Fine if you just want to chill with other tourists. Happy to recommend the tour. It was just as described.
651,If you are just going to visit Bali when you go to Indonesia then you absolutely missing out on a real treat. Go and visit lombok Island to the east. Do this trip with yarn at intrepid. It's an amazingly fun trip and you will just have the best time. And it's got some amazing snorkeling
652,"Loved my Lombok tour. The first time I've ever done a group trip. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience. And have learnt so much more about the people, and culture of this beautiful island. Already thinking about where next to travel with Intrepid."
653,"Lombok really is a hidden gem. I had a great time on this tour, seeing the typical rice fields, hiking to hidden waterfalls and snorkeling along the coastline of the Gili Islands."
654,"Our leader Spicy was not only our tour leader but felt like family. His incredible knowledge, great communication skills with the group & organising of the whole trip was a 10/10. If you want to tour a different island than Bali, then Lombok is your go to- off the beaten track with a depth of culture & relgion."
655,"I had the most amazing experience on my tour to Lombok and Gili Air. I learned so much about the culture and the local people, visited stunning locations and indulged in local cuisine. Our guide and fellow travellers made this experience one I will never forget."
656,"Excellent tour. My first but definitely not my last with Intrepid. Our leader Yan created a safe and welcoming atmosphere which continued for the whole trip. Excellent destinations, transport, food and company. Do it!!"
657,"This great was great as it had balances of learning the culture and history of the country but then having that time to just relax by the beach ,my group leader was Yan I definitely recommend him he was Allways looking out for my group and doing more than we asked for he was really the leader who made the trip come together smoothly for us."
658,"Spicey is an amazing tour guide. Lots of fun and very caring, but also very organized and professional. We all loved him!!! Lombok was a great destination. Will definitely go back in the furure."
659,"A fantastic trip! We visited amazing places and saw so much. We swam with 10+ turtles, walked through waterfalls and interacted with the locals. Great trip!"
660,"Do not have high expectations for the places you stay. Beds are rocks, blankets are sheets, bugs are everywhere, and so on. Have high expectations on the sights you see and the people you‚Äôll meet though."
661,"I loved Lombok! I came into this trip following on from ‚ÄòBeautiful Bali‚Äô, and Lombok was my favourite part of the whole two week experience! The cultural experience this tour provided was something which I would never have been able to source myself. Plus ending on some chilled days in Gili Air perfectly rounded off the adventurous journey. Our trip leader ‚ÄòAndy Swandy‚Äô gave us a true local experience and our group of 7 thoroughly enjoyed his and one another‚Äôs company."
662,"This is my 8th trip with intrepid, it did not disappoint. For those seeking an Island paradise away from the hustle and bustle of Bali, definitely visit Lombok."
663,"This trip is nothing short of amazing! I thoroughly recommend! Great destinations, great experiences, great sense of adventure & great comradeship throughout. Our guide was fantastic!"
664,Fantastic short tour of an amazing country. And Yan is the best tour leader!
665,Fantastic trip around Lombok. It had a more wild and authentic vibe compared to Bali and felt more off the beaten track which was exactly what we were looking for. Would highly recommend visiting Lombok as part of your Indonesia trip.
666,"Wonderful Lombok 8 day trip, so many different experiences - mountain area and waterfalls, agriculture, village industries, family homes, snorkelling and remote islands. Fun, caring, and enthusiastic leader Andy shared so much local insights that made it extra special"
667,"Our guide Abe great. Very friendly, organised and informative. We went to places I never would have gone by myself and thoroughly, enjoyed it. All guides along the way were awesome. Accommodation was on the more basic side but still very comfortable."
668,"Discovered Lombok on the second half of our Bali trip and it did not disappoint. Lombok is what I think about when I think about Bali. The snorkeling was incredible! Our tour leader, Yan, was knowledgeable, approachable and hilarious. I would recommend doing both Bali and Lombok if you can but if I had to pick one, Lombok is what I would choose."
669,"If you like the culture of Bali without the traffic chaos and over westernisation, then you are going to love Lombok. This trip offers the opportunity to take in a BIG clean breath of everything that is amazing about this part of the world, and let's you enjoy island life on Gilli Air surrounded by the turtles and coral reefs, soaking up the spectacular sunsets with memories that will last forever."
670,"Just do it. Great value, great food, great service...you will have a great time!!"
671,Great overview of Lombok island
672,"This trip was brilliant for us. We were immensely in both culture and nature. Our guide, Fidel, made the trip for us he was brilliant. A couple more inclusions would have made it even better when got to Gili air but overall a great experience. Thank You Fidel"
673,"Overall our Lombok Discovery trip was just an amazing cultural experience thanks to our very talented, most informative and humble tour guide In Fidel Yuwono. We can‚Äôt thank him enough for our time in Lombok."
674,Stay away from Lombok unless you like being woken up at 5am by people chanting and your guide taking endlessly about his religion
675,One of the best trips I‚Äôve been on! I went with a family member and we got to make some amazing memories. Our guide Maman was a huge reason we have a memorable trip! 10/10 recommend.
676,"Great trip, loved exploring Lombok. Our guide yan was excellent. The snorkelling and waterfall were real highlight."
677,"Andy did amazing job. He didn‚Äôt pick the hotels. My back is sore, I haven‚Äôt slept in 5 nights. The hotels are just above basic. I would send my worst enemy to sleep there."
678,This trip was really enjoyable and if you are thinking of travelling to Indonesia or Bali I'd recommend this trip. We snorkeled in some really beautiful locations and had an amazing tour leader Fidel who looked after us all really well! Thanks for a great travel experience.
679,"This was a trip for my soul. Fidel took care of all the worries of travelling, I was able to relax, enjoy the fantastic company, and learn about a new part of this wonderful planet. Thank you Intrepid - I‚Äôll be back!"
680,"A life-enriching cultural experience in beautiful Lombok, which perfectly showcased Indonesian life in an authentic way and provided a winning combination of countryside living and secluded snorkelling spots for turtle-spotting. The idyllic Gili Air was the best way to end the trip."
681,A good trip for first time visitors to Bali. Guna was a fantastic guide who was informative about all the places we visited.
682,An exceptional trip that provides a great mix of understanding the culture and exploring crystal clear waters . Thank you to our leader Yan for making it so memorable
683,"I'm not going to write this now, as I have already experienced this form ""timing out"" once already. If you would like a public review, please email me and I shall submit it to you via email."
684,"Discover Lombok was a fabulous tour. Fascinating island not overrun with tourists. Local guide Ell was great, being from Lombok himself his knowledge/local insights were amazing and really added to the trip. The quiet east coast was stunning. Highly recommend this trip!"
685,"So many ways this trip could be improved, especially by intrepid using your leaders who want to be there and do a good job"
686,"I took my very first group trip with Intrepid a few weeks ago. I had dreamt of visiting a far east remote location and I took the plunge and the risk in signing up. I was beyond impressed every inch of the experience from the Group leader, the guides that helped us with all of the local activities to the accommodations and travel. One must be very open minded when being in a very different culture and environment to what one is used to. It is a daily reminder to be courteous and kind to others in your group and locals. This was a life time experience for me and I would love to have another one. I do also realize in reality as a great reminder to myself I must keep being fit and healthy in order to go on such a long distance and remote trip like the one I just experienced."
687,Had the most wonderful time! Our tour leader was fabulous and shared his local knowledge of this beautiful island. There are so many amazing things to see and experience. Would highly recommend this tour.
688,I was a little nervous about what to expect from the trip because it was my first group event. I was blown away by everything and could not have dreamed a better experience. Lombok was amazing and Intprepid surpassed my expectations.
689,"A much slower paced trip than Beautiful Bali which is fine if you are happy with downtime. Lombok in-comparison underdeveloped. Food fabulous. Travelled solo and was able to arrange own room for days 2/5 which was lovely. Highlights definitely Snorkeling, Gili and local villages. Our leader Mochi was exceptional and we had the best group of people ever!"
690,This was a great trip with great new friends. Our guide Mochi was just an excellent fit with the group and made the whole trip so much fun. This was my first trip with this company but for sure it will not be my last. Intrepid is a great company with for those who do not want to put too much thought into planning everything.
691,This was my first trip with Intrepid but not my last! Loved the small group size and local experiences. Fun and educational!
692,"If you‚Äôre looking for an Intrepid trip with a cultural exchange, this trip offers very little (compared to many other trips taken with Intrepid)."
693,"Our tour leader, Ell (Jielly), was fantastic. He created such a welcoming environment for all of us, went out of his way to make sure we were having fun and feeling good, and was so generous in sharing his stories and connections with us. I'm so pleased to have made a new friend in Ell! The tour itself was great, so wonderful to see another side of Indonesia away from the hustle and bustle of Bali. A trip I will remember fondly forever"
694,"Travelling around Bali and Lombok with Intrepid was easily the best experience of my life. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, and was able to learn so much about Indonesian culture, and enjoyed so many once in a lifetime experiences that I would have never been able to do travelling alone or with friends. Furthermore, I felt incredibly fulfilled that I was able to support local communities and projects led by the Intrepid team that are actually making a change in people's lives. Cannot recommend enough!"
695,"Discover Lombok was an amazing tour and one that I would highly recommend to others. There was a great mix of cultural activities, delicious food, snorkelling and exploring. Highlight was definitely the waterfall swim and the snorkelling day. Our tour guide Mochi was amazing. Every day she greeted us with a smile, she was organised and helpful with assisting with booking things. I met some incredible people who I feel will become lifelong friends. Can't wait for my next intrepid trip!"
696,"After doing both the Bali and Lombok tours it was amazing to see the unique culture of these islands from wedding processions to fire dances, while doing amazing activities like snorkelling and hiking."
697,"This was the best trip (and we‚Äôve been on many) that my wife and I have been on. Everything is planned out and organized so no time was spent by us figuring out travel, accommodations, or meals. We were able to see so much of Bali, Lombok, and Gili Air. We learned so much about the people and culture. The excursions were world class and our guide helped make our trip unforgettable."
698,"The trip is pretty nice, not a lot of exercise, the walk to the waterfall is mainly by steps like a long staircase. Food was amazing! The Gili islands snorkeling is great, and Gili Air is a relaxing small island with nice beaches. Our guide Palguna was great, I do recommend it for someone that wants to go to enjoy some good Indonesian food and relax."
699,"Bali Trip was absolutely worth the money, great activities with a great leader. Nice rice terraces, beachlife at lovina, a fantastic hike to the mount batur and the touristy ubud. If you book the lombok adventure too, you will have less activities at lombok and a chillier trip, but Lomboks nature, which is less touristy is also worth it. Make sure to book some additional days on one of the gilis to chill out at the end of your trip."
700,"I absolutely loved my (first) Intrepid trip! Our tour guide Wayan was fantastic, I experienced and saw the country as I wouldn‚Äôt have with another tour (lots of local guides, local knowledge and fantastic places) and I met great people within the group. I can only recommend it!"
701,The Lombok trip is fantastic for spending time in villages learning about the local culture and for adventures snorkelling in coral reefs. I recommend it highly!
702,The Intrepid ‚Äòexperience‚Äô delivers authentic journeys through another country and culture with a knowledgeable guided tour.
703,Great trip all round highly recommended
704,"I travelled with a friendly group of people from around the world, who all contributed to having an excellent trip. Fidel (leader) was fantastic and worked very hard to overcome any challenges to ensure the whole group had a memorable experience."
705,"Discover Lombok was a great trip! We got to experience local culture, ate some amazing food and viewed some stunning scenery. The waterfall hike, rice terrace trek and snorkelling were all amazing. Gili Air at the end was the perfect few days to relax before heading home. Srix our trip leader was incredibly kind, welcoming, accommodating and knowledgeable. I highly recommend this trip!"
706,Srix was fantastic and really helpful and professional
707,Fun and interesting tour with a great guide.
708,Best trip ever! My travel leader was the best! The activities on this trip was a bit exhausting but incredibly worth it. Meeting the locals and learning about their traditions and lifestyle was amazing. I would recommend this trip to all of my friends to do!
709,"What a great, well balanced trip. It provides great diversity in activities while still allowing flexibility. Our group leader was simply the best we have every had and due to his knowledge and experience we had a fantastic, fun filled trip. Highly recommend this trip"
710,"This was a great trip, because we were able to escape the hustle and bustle of Bali. Activities were well-planned; our guide was friendly and helpful."
711,"Another great trip with Intrepid, visiting Lombok for the first time. Highlights included seeing how the locals lived and worked in a weaving village and also the traditional Sasak community. Our guide Yan also generously invited us to break fast and have dinner with his family during Ramadan; which is an experience you could never achieve travelling on your own. Accommodation far exceeded my expectations and was actually very luxurious in parts. The only downfall was our tour group was small with two thirds already having travelled to Bali together so it was a bit hard to break into that dynamic and we didn‚Äôt get a welcome dinner to break ice as the first night was their farewell Bali dinner. I‚Äôd suggest an extra night in Sanur for the Bali tour so those leaving can say goodbye; then a fresh start for the new group the next night. It‚Äôs pretty disappointing to start your holiday without a welcome dinner. That aside; highly recommend this tour!"
712,"I really enjoyed my holiday and appreciated the variety of experiences and contrast between busy Bali and the more relaxed Lombok. Loved the snorkeling and stay in Sibetan village. Many thanks to our tour leader Srix for her great organisation, help, and enthusiasm!"
713,I have been lucky to have traveled on 3 different trips with Intrepid...each one was different in there own way but each equally enjoyable Intrepid and there guides provide memorable experiences for the travelling guests and an insight to local cultures and communities to help and promote diversity Also there trips are bloody good fun üòÄ
714,"Go with intrepid and you will have a fun and informative trip, with comfort and safety in mind. Our leader was excellent and I am sure all leaders will be. I felt as the traveller we were always thought of first. Please give it a try and have fun."
715,"Lombok with Intrepid was a marvellous experience. For solo travellers it offers loads of local activities which are often difficult to organize for one person. This trip covered the mid & north part of Lombok as we made our way counter clockwise around the majestic volcano of Rinjani. Muslim culture with calls to prayer, women working at weaving, pottery & rice production along with creative food options were highlights. Well worth an add on if you find yourself in Indosnesia!"
716,"Lombok is a hidden gem. I highly recommend this Intrepid trip, truly off the beaten path. It is such an interesting contrast to Bali. Our guide Wayan, was wonderful and so obviously valued and loved by the locals. Don't miss it!"
717,Just completed the Lombok tour and had a great time with our guide Andy. Would recommend this trip and the highlight was also finishing on Gili Air. Loved Lombok and the Gili Isles. Well worth coming here and experiencing the Lombok way of life !
718,"Discover Lombok was an excellent trip. It's a great itinerary filled with some physical activity, relaxation, and cultural immersion. Highly recommend!"
719,Lombok was just an island next to Bali but after visiting its so much more
720,"Discover Lombok was a laid back cruisy trip through Lombok. Each day had an interesting activity, transport and accommodation was good, I enjoyed travelling with the other travellers in our group and the tour leader Corina Aritona was excellent. I‚Äôll probably return to Lombok at some point. It was good to see it now before it becomes too overdeveloped with tourists."
721,"Bali & Lombok This was my first Intrepid trip and it was just amazing! A nice mix of activities. Learned more of the way of living in Bali & Lombok, explained by excellent and enthousiastic local guides. The accomodations were comfortable, clean and some of them surrounded by stunning views. I had the pleasure of having lovely people in the group with a mix of ages and to be guided by an excellent tourleader (Corry Aritona). Indonesia stole my heart and I'm defintely coming back to explore the other islands, most likely with Intrepid."
722,This trip was absolutely incredible! The perfect match between local culture and nature! The hike to the waterfall and feeling the fresh water is something I'll never forget!
723,"Urs i recommend this trip to be taken, we where in good hands. Everything eas amazing, unforgettable"
724,"I've travelled with Intrepid many times because I like the use of local guides and a commitment to local culture, customs and local people"
725,The best way to possibly get around. Really worth the money and I loved the experience as a 21 year old. Meet super cute locals + feel genuinely happy after doing this
726,"Excellent trip, Tantan our guide was wonderful ensuring we had the best experiences and long lasting memories. Beautiful beaches, amazing scenery, snorkelling with turtles, spending time with the locals, even experiencing a traditional Lombok wedding. Highly recommend this authentic trip."
727,"A fantastic experience. I learnt so much, got the opportunity to explore a beautiful part of the world and met amazing people along the way."
728,I enjoyed this trip emensly and will be looking forward to another trip with Wayan Sudiana.
729,"A perfect mix of education and adventure. Led by a very knowledgeable leader, Nova. I'll be talking about this trip for many years"
730,"The Lombok tour was very worthwhile, with an enjoyable itinerary and a good balance of activity, sight seeing and relaxation. Lombok is not as touristy as Bali and so makes for a different (and enjoyable) experience."
731,"After doing the Bali Intrepid tour in 2019 and enjoying it a lot, I was keen to go on the Lombok tour. Again, it was a well paced, fun, informative, and interesting trip very well led by Maman. Good food, snorkelling, waterfalls, beaches, traditional village tours, enjoyable hikes through picturesque rice and other plantations."
732,"Communication, admin, and support shocking by Intrepid. Leaders have to wing it, with no support from the company whatsoever. Have to do everything. Groups luckily have been good."
733,Fantastic trip from start to finish! Excellent way to view authentic Indonesia without all the tourists. Great activities and stunning scenery throughout. Highly recommend!
734,"This trip is one of the most memorable trips I had! The knowledgeable and helpful guide, the amazing group, the authentic experience, the friendliness of locals all contributed to that. It happened that my birthday was during the trip and it was very touching to have it organized in such a fabulous way! Thank you Intrepid!"
735,Lombok is a destination which should be on everyone‚Äôs travel list! I would recommend this trip to anyone!
736,Intrepid does not respond to their emails. You have to wait two to three hours to get hold of them if phoning. Shocking appaling service.
737,"Lombok is a truly beautiful place, with wonderful people and great culture. I had a fantastic time on this trip (snorkelling especially), and feel lucky to have done it with the wonderful group of people who signed up and our trip leader, Yan! If you're considering this trip, I'd highly recommend booking!"
738,"Thoroughly enjoyed this trip! Abraham was a fantastic guide and we completed an itinerary that would be impossible to book on your own. Highlights were the snorkelling, rice fields and a local Lombok wedding. Would highly recommend this trip, thanks Abraham!"
739,"This trip as a whole was one of the best experiences i have ever had. I met such lovely people, had a brilliant leader and seen such beautiful places. I highly recommend this trip to anyone. I was a solo traveller who didnt know what to expect and i have learnt a lot about myself on this trip. Thank you so much interpid and Wayan for one of the best experiences."
740,"Lombok the additional trip on Bali is well worth while, another religion, more cultural things, more fish for snorkeling, Gili islands have better night life at the moment. When tourism picks up the islands will be rammed"
741,Review
742,Great trip but more ' off the beaten track' than other Indonesian trips which is exactly what I wanted. Hiking to see the orangutans was amazing although good level fitness is needed as it's very humid. Surprising highlight was samisor island. Tour and local guide was fab.
743,"If you love nature and wildlife, this trip is for you. We were lucky to see six orangutans. Two adult males, and then two Moms with their playful kids swinging on the trees in separate parts of the jungle. We also saw three other varieties of monkeys, and many tropical jungle creatures. Great hike to the volcano summit. Our leader guide, and all local guides were excellent. They all gave us great insight to the local culture. A great chance to try delicious regional food, and tropical fruit juices."
744,"We had a great trip. In the jungle we saw plenty of gibbons, orangutan and other animals including flying lizard. The volcano hike was beautiful and very atmospheric. Excellent guide (Dewi) and a very friendly atmosphere on the trip. Food costs c.¬£3.50 per meal (where not included)"
745,"It was an incredible experience, I will never forget what I experienced and I am especially grateful to Dewi our guide as she made the trip something very special."
746,A really great trip and a must if you want to see orang utans in the wild. Sumatra is not as geared up for tourism as most of SE Asia so be prepared eat with the locals etc.
747,"If you want to see orangutans, climb a volcano, view stunning landscapes in the beautiful Samosir Island then this trip is for you. Bear in mind that in order to see some of this you will need a reasonable level of fitness to cover ground in a hilly jungle or climbing steep slopes. If all of the above fits then don‚Äôt hesitate to book this trip."
748,Wonderful trip off the beaten path. LiliK was a great guide. This was such a good trip
749,"This tour visits Bukit Lawang, Berastagi and Lake Toba, all very worthwhile destinations. Hotels, and food, are all excellent and the Sumatran people we met very helpful."
750,Sumatra trip was great for those wanting to see wildlife especially gibbons and orangutans but the overnight jungle trip was difficult as the campsite is very basic and unfortunately some of us were unwell for this part of the trip. The coffee is amazing and for the uninitiated it was a wonderful introduction to the Indonesian cuisine
751,"What an experience. Travelling as a family, we got to climb a volcano and saw orang-utans in the wild. Couldn't ask for more from Intrepid."
752,Excellent trip. Wonderful and knowledgeable guide. Thank you Lili
753,"Awesome adventure, totally recommended. our guide was very knowledgeable and always available."
754,"Experiencing Sumatra was difficult at times but a real pleasure, and Intrepid offers a wonderful small group active tour with comfortable lodging after active days. This particular trip had extensive driving on awful roads, which definitely detracted from the overall experience, especially given our tight schedule. Might've been good to focus on two spots instead of three with less travel, or incorporate air travel?"
755,"This was an amazing trip with a wonderful bunch of like minded, fun travellers. The itinerary was great and included many wonderful activities. Of course the best was seeing orangutans in the jungle."
756,"This trip was great! Seeing wild Orangutans was the highlight for me, as well as Seeing other wildlife. The trekking was good fun, but you do need to be moderately fit to do it. This was also a cultural trip, and it was nice to learn how the locals live"
757,"This tour provides a wonderful introduction to the highlights of North Sumatra. Seeing orangutans in the wild, learning more about the Batak people, their culture and customs and witnessing the beauty of Lake Toba were definitely the highlights for me. Lily was also a brilliant tour leader who made sure the itinerary ran smoothly and everyone was well looked after. If you like hiking and nature then this is the trip for you!"
758,"A really good trip to find out about North Sumatra, lots of Orangutans and monkeys, plenty of incredible scenery."
759,Amazing way to see orang-utans and Sumatra
760,This trip gives insight to Sumatra and where one would want to stay longer.
761,This trip gives insight to Sumatra and where one would want to stay longer.
762,"Was a very enjoyable tour, the combination of a diverse itinerary, excellent local knowledge, interesting cultural and food experiences made for an amazing tour. Great team of people involved in the tour, team leader Dewi was excellent."
763,As a non strict vegetarian I found this trip amazing and easy to find food. Lilik was very attentive and made sure my food needs were looked after. I likely ate the occasional shrimp paste and chicken stock but this could have been avoided by shopping differently.
764,Best trip ever. Amazing guides and beautiful country. Take seasick pill if you get motion sickness some rough windy roads. Vegetarians/Vegans will find plenty to eat. I had no trouble at all. River crossing in jungle definitely needs either the rubber shoes you can buy - get the right size or some type of sandals. Loved every minute.
765,"Fantastic trip that showed us some highlights of beautiful Sumatra. Every guide we had was fantastic and made the trip wonderful, especially our main guide, Dewi. 10/10 recommend this trip."
766,This trip was excellent - very well organised and a good balance of activity and down time. The guide was brilliant and the number of people on the trip was just right.
767,"I had a lovely trip! Dewi was an excellent tourguide. We went to the jungle and climbed a volcano! It was really nice and I would recommend you going, even if you are not a hiker! I am not and I could do it!"
768,"The price we paid for the trip was worth it. It was a really nice experience. We like an adventurous travel such as camping, hiking/trekking so this one exceeded our expectations. I would definitely recommend this tour to everyone."
769,A wonderful trip from trekking in the jungle to the beauty and serenity of Lake Toba and lots in between.
770,"A wonderful introduction to Sumatra! The jungle trekking is excellent ‚Äì saw heaps of wildlife, including orangutans! Also very much enjoyed learning about the Batak people and culture. Berestagi and Lake Toba are spectacular. It was a pleasure to have Lily as our group leader; who is so knowledgeable and passionate."
771,"Great trip-saw orangutans and many other species of monkeys, gibbons, and baboons."
772,"the tour was amazing! you will see the ""real"" indonesia. if you like jungle, this is your trip! could not immagine, to do this, no i did. would do it again!"
773,"Great trip to Sumatra, really enjoyed the orang-utans and volcano walk. I would recommend this to anybody wanting to experience something different."
774,"Short trip that felt it was off the beaten track taking in jungles, Orangutans, volcanos and tropical islands - what's not to like?"
775,"This was the trip of a lifetime! Sumatra is naturally beautiful and you will see incredible wildlife. Plus there are dogs and cats everywhere! The perfect trip for an animal lover. Dewi our leader went above and beyond, and made the trip so much fun. Could not recommend more for lifelong memories!"
776,"What a trip! The people, the locations - everything was great. The jungle, Mt Sibayak & other climbs are physical but worth it. There are also some long periods in the bus for traveller bonding! Just make the most of every opportunity you are given on this trip!"
777,"Sumatra Adventure was truly an adventure. Orang-utans and monkeys in the jungle, camping in tents by the river, climbing to top of volcano, eating too much yummy local food and fresh fruit, mixing with the local friendly people who welcomed us to their country with open arms and treated us like celebrities was all amazing."
778,"North Sumatra was magical with perfect balance of jungle, geology, and culture. Lily was a wonderful guide. Very experienced"
779,"This trip surpassed my expectations in terms of organisation, enjoyment and accommodation. Lilly was an excellent and caring guide. It was my first experience with Intrepid and I would definitely go on another Intrepid trip as a result."
780,A truly eye-opening trip to the wonders of Sumatra. Got to see orangutans up close. Very knowledgeable guide leader and local guides.
781,Great trip! We got to see the orangutans and really enjoyed the volcano hike. The trip was a good mix of learning local culture and being active. It definitely makes me interested in the rest of Sumatra. Just one tip - bring thickly woven socks / leech socks and insect repellant. It rained heavily the night before our hike and even the guide said she hadn‚Äôt seen that many leeches before.
782,"Sumatra Adventure is a fast-paced, active and exciting way to see this beautiful island. Pack smart and light with good trekking shoes and a sense of adventure. Medan and Bukit Lawang are hot - the mountains are much cooler. I encourage you to try all the local food, chat with the keen local high school students who will chase after you to practice their conversation, take a decent camera to capture the orangutans in the wild and soak up beautiful Sumatra in it's many variations."
783,"My first trip with Intrepid will not be my last! It far exceeded my expectations. Wonderful leadership, the itinerary, successful animal sightings due to good guides and choice of accommodation all made it such a winner. The itinerary between the different activities was also thoughtfully planned. Big Thankyou.."
784,Excellent tour to a beautiful country. Lilik (tour leader) was amazing! Highlight was spotting the orangutangs!
785,"A life changing trip! The jungle, volcano and Lake Toba were all highlights for me and the tour leader Lily was truly excellent."
786,"Amazing trip, exceeded my expectations. Great combo of culture, nature, activities and good food. Our trip leader Dewi was exceptional."
787,This was an amazing trip in an amazing location. Dewi was an excellent group leader and really helped us to integrate with our surroundings. The various local guides and drivers performed at a level far beyond my expectations.
788,"Even more than I expected! Made me remember, what I love about traveling"
789,Review
790,"This was a really special tour with a fab itinerary. The train journeys were a fantastic way to see views of the countryside in comfort. We had the wonderful Mochi as our leader who brought boundless enthusiasm and passion for her job. And last, but not least, we had a fantastic group who very quickly became great friends."
791,Great overview of Java and Bali.lots of ground covered with a variety of activity. Good standard of accommodation and meals. Great value for money.
792,I believe the guide made this trip an exceptional trip
793,This trip is spectacular. The perfect blend of culture and indonesias natural wonders. It is a balanced and relaxed schedule. I found it a good balance as travel days can be long so the intensity was perfect giving me time to explore on my own as well. Bromo and snorkelling are highlights. Wow! Unforgettable. ISA was the best guide and you‚Äôll be lucky to get him! What a wonderful human being with passion for his country.
794,Intrepid was a professional travel company and I very much enjoyed Indonesia.
795,"Thorough introduction to Java with an outstanding tour leader. Isa was great and I felt like we really got to see all the highlights of Java, and some of the Bali ones. Java is not very touristy but IMO is far more charming than Bali. Felt safe and comfortable the whole way."
796,This trip fulfilled my expectations and more. The experiences I had were incredible. We got to learn about the cultures and try food I never thought I would. My guide was fantastic!! I would highly recommend
797,A fantastic trip with a varied itinerary - this really felt like we were off the beaten track & seeing the real Indonesia. Highlights included catching the sunrise over Mount Bromo and cycling through the gorgeous surroundings of Yogyakarta. Nova was an exceptional guide and went above and beyond!
798,"This was my 29th Intrepid trip since 2000. Intrepid‚Äôs ability to cull from the myriad options available at any destination separates it from other travel operators and I am sure the envy of some. I have repeatedly found their swift, smooth and efficient execution amazing. Intrepid is my go to operator whenever I am thinking of travel. Kudos Intrepid!"
799,Our Intrepid trip across Java with guide Nova was AMAZING!!!
800,Our Intrepid trip across Java with guide Nova was AMAZING!!!
801,The trip from Bangkok to Bali is overpriced for CDN dollar
802,"This trip was excellent, allowing me as a fairly inexperienced traveler to travel somewhere completely new, unique, and difficult to travel alone. The tour gives an in depth perspective of Java, allowing you to see many aspects of the current and historical culture. Isa was an amazing guide who looked after us all well, provided so much information and a local perspective, and was always available for questions or guidance. I had a great time, made new friends, and experienced a new country like I never have before. The trip also gives most afternoons free to explore or participate in optional activities depending on your interest and often with some group buddies which was really fun."
803,Highly recommended for first time and solo travellers in South East Asia.
804,This trip was extraordinary and very educational. I loved learning more about Indonesian culture and history. The itinerary was incredible
805,"We learned a lot about Indonesia, its culture and very interesting history on this trip. There were adventures every day. We were awestruck by the beautiful environment with its lush flora and fauna, its volcanic mountains and especially the friendly Indonesians. Highlights included swimming in the Green Canyon and sunrise at Mt Bromo."
806,"My trip was an incredible experience from start to finish. The trip was exceptionally well-organized, offering a perfect mix of adventure, culture, and relaxation. The itinerary was diverse and well-planned, allowing us to explore the stunning landscapes and rich cultural heritage of Indonesia. Highlights included visiting the ancient temples of Borobudur and Prambanan, and relaxing on the beautiful beaches of Bali. Each location was unique and offered something special. Our guides were outstanding‚Äîknowledgeable, friendly, and passionate about their country. They provided us with fascinating insights into the local culture and history, making each destination come alive. The group was perfect, I had the chance to meet some great people. Intrepid‚Äôs commitment to responsible travel was evident throughout the trip. We stayed in locally-owned accommodations, dined at local restaurants, and participated in community-based tourism activities. It was clear that Intrepid values sustainability and supports the local communities we visited."
807,"Highly recommend a very good trip, we enjoyed every single day with the group and the leader, it was very organized and exciting, you can enjoy your time, and the country, as the Tour leader takes care of anything else"
808,"Thoughtfully conducted tours in meeting local artisan trades; learning island focused religion & tribes virtues and characteristics; got close & encountered nature, floral, fauna, and volcano geo. Flexible in how much participation & how deep culture immersions one wanted. üôè"
809,"This trip was excellent! Abraham the tour leader was very knowledgable and organised. We were never left guessing. Highlights included Yogyakarta, Mt Bromo and the Green Canyon. The trains are excellent."
810,"We did this trip tagged onto the end of the Sumatra trip and the two made a fantastic 22 days. Abraham, our leader had brilliant local knowledge and really made the trip one to remember."
811,"Great trip. Highlights were the friendly local people, beauty of Mt Bromo sunrise and Borodurur temple. Abraham was a fantastic guide."
812,"This trip allows the travellers to see more of Indonesia culture and religions, compared to just a visit to touristy Bali. So if you really want to say you have visited Indonesia l would recommend this trip. Bali is also lovely as are all the Indonesia people l met on my trip. Gentle and kind and so helpful!"
813,"The journey offers an exceptional blend of natural beauty, culture, culinary journey of discovery and activities. Thanks to the trains, the long travel days are relaxed and you get to see a lot of the countryside. Our tour leader Irfan was knowledgeable and adaptable, offering both practical guidance and cultural insights and ensuring a personalized experience."
814,"Highly recommend the adventure tour through Java into Bali. Very well organised. Decent level of fitness needed to make the most of it, but so well worth the effort, especially sunrise on Mt. Bromo."
815,Fantastic tour capturing many of the major sights in Java and Bali and also a few off the beaten track sights too. Highlight of the trip was the sunrise view of Mount Bromo
816,Great trip through Java with excellent range of activities. The sunrise trip to Mt Bromo was unpleasant with the 1.30 am wake up and then 1 hour windy trip in jeeps in petrol fumes- my only negative experience of this otherwise fabulous trip. Dian the tour guide was exceptional and has been on be of the outstanding leaders on the 8 trips we have taken with Intrepid
817,Include all the comments I have mentioned so far as to my highlights
818,Really enjoyable trip. A mix of tourist and off the beaten path meeting local people yo experience the real Java.
819,"This was a nice tour to see many unique sites in Java from temples, to volcanoes and beaches, this trip allows you to see."
820,We had an amazing trip with intrepid and will definitely be using them every time we travel from now on.
821,A very wonderful and exciting trip in Indonesia covering most of the essential cultural sites and natural wonders.
822,"Fabulous trip! Nova was an amazing guide, and made all the travelling easy and straightforward. Lovely bunch of fellow travellers. Great hotels. A nice range of activities and mix of touristy destinations and more off the beaten track ones where you got to see the real Indonesia."
823,I highly recommend Intrepid as a way to see and experience Indonesia. My Jakarta to Ubud trip was a brilliant way to immerse yourself in the beauty and culture of Java from a local perspective which was our exceptional tour guide Maman who showed me and my delightful fellow intrepid travellers his country. Wonderful memories to cherish for a long time of this travel adventure.
824,"The trip Jakarta to Ubud has many interesting places to visit more than I expected before attending this trip. The highlight for me is Green canyon, Borobudur and Prambanan temples, and Mt Bromo. Seloliman natural reserves and Kalibaru are very relaxing to stay. Travelling along Java by train is very comfortable."
825,A great itinerary guided by an experienced tour lead. It‚Äôs a great tour to experience what Java can offer and a taste of Bali. The opportunities to interact with the locals were plenty. Give it a try - you will love this tour!
826,"Wonderful experience, great tour leader, great group, with such a variety of nationalities, I really had a great time and feel like coming back to Indonesia some day."
827,"Amazing trip, love everything about it! I would rather spend just one night in Jakarta tho because there are multiple places where we could‚Äôve stayed longer!"
828,"Intrepid Tours is your go-to for eco-friendly tourism which provides the perfect blend of travel, exploration, and food with a particular emphasis on local hospitality. The use of homestays and local restaurants which pumps money directly back into the local economy is simply fantastic!"
829,"We had a very enjoyable few weeks in Java. The trip was well organised and well paced. The train trips were excellent and a great way of travelling in Indonesia. All the included activities were really interesting and enjoyable. The guide looked after us so well, taking care of every little detail."
830,"The trip was fantastic and guided by a great guide (thank you SuperNova). What I specially liked was the local little visits to Villages, plantations, rice fields, the little places of real local life where there is no mass tourism. The accommodations of this trip are basic (2.5 star), but they fit well with the nature of this trip. However the cleanliness of most rooms is a growing concern and Intrepid will need to intervene here. Let me end by telling you that the food on this trip was amazing on almost every occasion, very good restaurant tips from our guide Nova !"
831,"A brilliant first trip with Intrepid. Our guide Abraham was outstanding and the itinerary covered a fantastic range of places in Java and Bali. Highlights were the temples in Yogyakarta, Bromo and snorkelling in Bali."
832,"Our Intrepid tour was fantastic, and we are generally not ones to book a tour. Abraham, our tour leader, was extremely knowledgeable and approachable and really cared in introducing us to his homeland, in a sustainable, eco friendly way. I‚Äôd highly recommend Intrepid‚Äôs tour of Indonesia."
833,"Abraham is the best guide!! He is always ready and anticipating every need. 10/10 recommend. As a note since it didn‚Äôt say it in the essential information: almost every accommodation does have air conditioning so you don‚Äôt need to pack a fan like on some other trips. Overall, it‚Äôs a great tour and all of the optional activities are fun too!"
834,"Our Intrepid tour was fantastic, and we are generally not ones to book a tour. Abraham, our tour leader, was extremely knowledgeable and approachable and really cared in introducing us to his homeland, in a sustainable, eco friendly was. I‚Äôd highly recommend Intrepid‚Äôs tour of Indonesia."
835,"Three leg tours over 6 weeks- ranging from basic, to explorer to comfort. Every leg was as described, and was organised seamlessly. Local guides are fantastic and their use of specific guides for a particular area really improves the experience."
836,"The Jakarta to Ubud Trip, March 2024 was excellent in the overall amd was expertly led by a dedicated, helpful , capable and professional Leader and Guide , Susiyani."
837,"A great trip through Java to Bali with many wonderful experiences ‚Äì jungle walks, boat rides, swimming, cycling, volcano climbs ‚Äì and the opportunity to interact with local people, to get to know their way of life. Our guide, Corry Aritona, provided great insights and kept us energised at all times."
838,"Nova was very patient, helpful and knowledgeable. Intrepid has to do better with the choice in hotels (1-3star). The bus could also be a bit bigger for the long stretch. I paid single supplement and must have been the luck of the draw. In the 3 rooms i was assigned to the deposit box was not working, toilet not flushing and kettle was dirty(Kubuku). Intrepid was chosen due to small group."
839,"Choice in hotels/homestays could be better. We were placed in 1-3 star eco lodge while there are better ones and economical ones out there. Overall good experience/tour but if hotels can be better, and our free meals can be hot I would give this tour a 5 star. You can be comfortable in south east Asian country"
840,"Nova was very patient, helpful and knowledgeable. Intrepid has to do better with the choice in hotels (1-3star). The bus could also be a bit bigger for the long stretch. I paid single supplement and must have been the luck of the draw. In the 3 rooms i was assigned to the deposit box was not working, toilet not flushing and kettle was dirty(Kubuku). Intrepid was chosen due to small group."
841,"Intrepid‚Äôs tour of Java was well organized. Accommodations were comfortable; local guides did a good job teaching us about Javanese local industries; lots of exciting fun too, like peering into active volcanos, swimming in canyon gorge, etc., and above all, our tour leader was kind, knowledgeable, and great fun to be with."
842,"This trip from Jakarta to Unud was full of culture, adventure and laughter led by a fantastic, knowledgable and caring guide, Abraham. It is a great introduction to Indonesia and makes us want to explore more of this very diverse country. The people are very friendly and love to chat and practice English. We enjoyed very much chatting to some students at a school we passed while out on a walking tour. Mt Bromo is spectacular and well worth the short climb to the crater. We would highly recommend this trip to anyone looking to explore and enjoy a new culture. The long train rides were very comfortable and enjoyable with great scenery to view. Thanks for another great Intrepid trip."
843,"This trip was a great introduction to Indonesian culture with a very well balanced array of places and activities, lead well."
844,Great tour with a very diverse itinerary with some long travel days (trains are very comfortable!) which meant you get to see so much from impressive historical sites and landscapes (Mt Bromo) to observing daily living while walking or biking through rural areas and rice fields. Don't forget to extend your tour in Bali as there is so much more to see and experience there.
845,"We had a great time, but there are some things that need improving. We were accosted by street sellers and our tour guide was nowhere to help get us out of the mob. We walked out in front of oncoming traffic to cross the street, as if that is not unsafe. I felt unsafe. Our tour guide didn't seem to want to be there. We had to ask him what we were seeing outside of our windows on our commutes. He never offered information. We often didn't have internet, like in Margo Utomo. There were huge ants in our hotel room(s). No one told us beforehand to come having already exchanged currency or to bring a charger converter. The good news - Green Canyon and the jungle trek (add on) were amazing. That tour guide was awesome!"
846,"Highly recommend this trip, so good to discover the culture and history of Java, with a relaxing finish in Bali. Highlights were mount bromo ( definitely worth the early start), snorkelling in Bali and sunset at the Jogja temples. Our guide Corry was excellent, great company and always had a smile on his face"
847,Corry was an excellent leader for our Jakarta to Ubud trip. Green Canyon is awesome!
848,I used intrepid for my Indonesian excursion. I was impressed most of all by the quality of the guides and intrepid's commitment to giving back to the culture and communities in which we toured. It has given me a new respect in myself towards the world in which I live.
849,"I thoroughly recommend the Java to Bali trip. It encompasses a wide variety of places and activities together with different modes of transport. Highlights for me were swimming in the Green Canyon, the temples near Yogyakarta plus the wildlife at Pangandaran. The Mt Bromo early morning trip is well worth it for the scenery and walk up to the crater edge."
850,"This trip was a wonderful opportunity to see new places, meet new people, while gaining an insight into Indonesia culture and history, through a variety of activities and options and friendly interesting guides. Susie our group leader was fantastic. An enjoyable and stimulating break."
851,"This trip is a great introduction to the diverse and rich cultures that make up Indonesia. There are some long travel days as described in the notes, but they're worth it. Our guide Susi was outstanding."
852,I could not recommend this trip enough. Traveling with an amazing group of people and seeing some beautiful places - my heart is full. A suggestion to add a stop at Handara Gate before arriving in Ubud. It‚Äôs a missed opportunity.
853,Another fantastic Intrepid trip to some areas as yet untouched by too may tourists
854,"An excellent trip with a fantastic leader, Ida, and nice fellow travellers. Java and interesting and beautiful country. Hardly saw any other western tourists until we reached bali."
855,"Excellent trip with a lot a variety in what we did and saw along the route. Ari (Corry Aritona), our leader, always went the extra mile to ensure the trip went smoothly and we had everything we needed. Make sure you go to his private view point of Mount Bromo it‚Äôs much better than at the top!"
856,"Truly exceptional trip, even for someone like me, who is used to self-organising and travelling solo. I really appreciated that Ari was super-flexible to accomodate individual preferences and styles of travelling, including my dietary requirements. The trip itself was a wonderful mix of cities and countryside, history and hiking, pictouresque train journeys and lots and lots of unique local flavours and personal touches, which is what really made it worth the money spent to my mind - there were many experiences we had that I could never organise on my own. Indonesia is a fascinating country and there's so much more to it than just Bali! Highly reccomend to anyone ready to discover this often overlooked country!"
857,"Es war eine tolle Erfahrung - f√ºr mich das erste Mal eine solche Gruppentour zu buchen. Ich hab wahnsinnig tolle Menschen kennengelernt. Die Route war super, die Inhalte h√§tte ich alleine (ohne viel Recherche - da ich √ñl w√ºrde hatte) nicht geschafft & niemals entdeckt. Das war echt eine tolle pers√∂nliche Erfahrung f√ºr mich."
858,"If you want a trip that is full of adventure then do this one. Indonesia was a revelation to me, a land full of smiling, welcoming people, beautiful scenery and seriously impressive volcanoes! Sharing it all with a likeminded group and an excellent leader called Abraham has ensured that these memories will stay with me forever."
859,"The Jakarta to Ubud trip has a variety of experiences, temples, beaches, cities, & rural areas. There are couple days of long travel but this was explained in trip notes. The included meals were excellent as was all the accommodation. Intrepid Leader Abraham went out of his way to make sure everyone had the best time possible. As well as being organised he was a fun guy & we all enjoyed his company. Other staff & drivers very good. Recommend this trip üëç"
860,"We did the classic Indonesia trip. We had a good mix of nationalities, age and gender. Along with an enthusiastic leader, this made it a very enjoyable trip. The small group size and a liberal amount of free time was very agreeable."
861,A great introduction to Indonesia with a range of interesting experiences. Our leader Arifanti (Mochi) was the best guide and travelling companion.
862,"This trip was a great way for me to discover Indonesia, both in terms of nature and culture. Fidel was a very dedicated tour leader"
863,"I looooved the trip! I‚Äòm only 18 and travelled alone, so the group trip was perfect for me! All the accommodations were good to excellent, we had so many different, interesting and fun activities and my leader (Nova) was a 10/10."
864,You don't want my review because I have little to say that is positive except that most of the other participants were nice people that I enjoyed traveling with.
865,"This was an awesome trip with the broad array of experiences it offered - walking up to the rim of a volcano at Mt Bromo, the jeep convoy to get there in the dark was such fun, swiming in a beautiful canyon, snorkelling in pristine waters near Pemuteran, beautiful temples and rice terraces, the use of very comfortable train travel to traverse the landscape; a great array of foods to try, markets to explore and incredibly friendly people. It really opened my eyes to what Indonesia has to offer."
866,An excellent and highly varied tour that gives visitors insight into the culture behind the tourism. Highly recommended.
867,"A fantastic introduction to the wonderful world of Indonesia - from city bustle to nature reserves, and beach views to volcano hikes - this trip was a delightful way to travel across Java and end in the beauty of Bali. Highly recommend for all curious travellers!"
868,"This trip was a fabulous experience and a great introduction to Java. Our group leader Susiyani was excellent, and she went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed the trip."
869,"This trip was a great introduction to Indonesia through the locations, activities and cultures we were lucky enough to experience. The included and optional activities we so amazing. In addition our tour leader Abraham was perfect!"
870,It was an unforgettable trip. The scenery was just wow!
871,Abraham made my Indonesia experience quite memorable. I truly appreciate his kindness and generosity.
872,"Great trip! Saw and experienced lots, and a good option in less touristy Java. Lots of travelling if you‚Äôre not into that. Abraham was a great leader. Enjoyed and recommend!"
873,"A really enjoyable experience! All planned out in a way we would never have thought out ourselves. Great, friendly guide and a group who jelled amazingly well."
874,"Great trip, covered a lot of miles by train (excellent way to travel) and wonderful people. Get their early as museums are closed on Mondays"
875,Excellent trip that allowed us to learn about Java and experience the wonderful friendly nature of the people there. I'd strongly recommend it!
876,A great itinerary led by a helpful and knowledgeable guide in Tantan. Fun accommodation (ecolodges etc) and Bali is every bit as special as everyone says!
877,This was an awful trip and I do not recommend it for women. Worst travel experience of my life (and the other women on the trip).
878,"Nova gets five stars as our guide! Very caring and approachable leader, who was always ready to help. Itinerary-wise Mt Bromo was my highlight. Low point was sharing a room with someone who should have booked a single supplement! Those who should do, rarely do, on Intrepid trips in my experience!"
879,This trip is very interesting from a cultural point of view. For us the level of activity too low.
880,A wonderful introduction to Java and Bali. I highly recommend this trip to anyone considering.
881,"Wonderful way to experience so much of what Indonesia has to offer - fantastic landscapes, cuisine, and hospitality!"
882,This tour was one of the best trips I‚Äôve taken. The itinerary is amazing and the guide Ari was just the most professional guide ever. The group size was perfect and Ari really made us a whole. I would highly recommend this tour of your looking for culture and nature!
883,"Trip was everything as described. The weather was hot at times and AC not available but accommodations seemed to be spaced strategically. Aside from the trip extras which I regret not doing, I saw everything and more that was described on their website."
884,Fantastic guide and itinerary for this trip with good accommodation and optional extras. I do not recommend doing the Thailand bangkok to Singapore trip before as the transfer from Singapore to joining the Java trip was not seamless on the Singapore end and the guide did not have the same level of detailed knowledge about the countries they were not native to
885,Amazing trip to really get under the skin of Java and Bali - Ida is the best tour guide I‚Äôve ver had and more than went the extra mile to ensure our group wanted for nothing.
886,"A great trip with a good mixture of culture, outdoor activities, insights and of course food. Excellent choice, if you want to get to know a most interesting country. Above all, our Tourguide Ida was outstanding in terms of commitment and information conveyed."
887,"Incredible trip, great guide. Indonesia is such a lovely country, the people are so friendly and the food is great. And sunrise over Mount Bromo is an experience of a lifetime."
888,"Amazing trip covering so many interesting destinations and made even better by our incredible group leader, Tantan"
889,"Abraham was an awesome tour leader who became one of our friends. We were all so grateful to see beautiful Indonesia with a mix of his support, knowledge, fun & lots of laughter!"
890,"Fantastic trip, great way to see Java. Fair bit of travelling involved but broken up well and lots to see on the way so never felt too much. Had the best leader (Corry Aritona) who gave us great opportunities to integrate with local community, and those are the memories that last the longest. First time we had booked with Intrepid very impressed, will be looking to book again."
891,"The trip was amazing with an extraordinary leader (Corry Aritona) who gave us some amazing opportunities to integrate with the local people and culture. Loads of travelling, but a lot of fun and we covered a lot of the country. Beautiful people and scenery, literally can't wait to go back.. (We were a family of four with 2 teenagers who have really got the travel bug now!)"
892,"Incredible experience traveling through Java, interacting with locals and participating in both tourist activities (Green Canyon boating, climbing Mt. Bromo) and local experiences (shucking rice in the rice field, seeing puppeteers at work)."
893,"A fantastic experience and a real insight into life on Java. I had some absolutely unforgettable experiences on this trip and encourage anyone coming to Indonesia for the first time to take this tour, you won't regret it."
894,"Excellent trip with amazing itinerary that allowed us to experience so much of Java! Our tour guide Abraham was AMAZING; so kind, friendly and fun. We loved our yogi bear tour guide !!! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
895,"This was a challenging, fun, informative, and at times thrilling adventure."
896,Java is a fascinating island. Very down to earth and tourism playing only a minor part. The group was so much fun with an awesome guide who steered us through sickness and health always with a smile.
897,"Amazing tour, great variety of activities and something for everyone. We got to experience so many things that wouldn‚Äôt have been possible if we had been travelling solo."
898,"Amazing tour, perfect variety of activities, adventure, culture, food and the arts. There was something for everyone! I was concerned about how long we would spend travelling over the two weeks but the travelling time went so quickly and wasn‚Äôt an issue, especially as you passed such beautiful scenery on the way. We got to experience so many amazing things that I‚Äôm not sure I would have been able to do if I was travelling solo like visits to local villages."
899,"Ida, our guide was amazing. Highly recommend this tour."
900,"This is an amazing trip, if you love adventures and experiencing bustling markets, stunning temples, rural life and villages and getting close to nature this is for you, you‚Äôll get to see so many hidden parts of Java and Bali and leave with the most wonderful memories"
901,"Overall, an amazing trip! I got super lucky with an amazing group of travelers and an exceptional leader. The trip covered lot of ground but never felt too much. Covered all the highlights of Java and touched a little bit of Bali."
902,My group leader Abrahan on this trip was incredible. The trip is as environmentally conscious as it can be. Evo resorts are used. Dont miss the temples they are incredible!
903,Review
904,"Travelling with people I had never met before was a completely new experience for me, and to be honest, a little daunting at first. But I was pleasantly surprised by how well I fitted in, even though English isn‚Äôt my first language. I met some truly wonderful people, and we shared so many memorable moments together. This journey helped me realise that it‚Äôs not only okay to be yourself ‚Äî it‚Äôs something to be proud of"
905,"This was my second experience with intrepid, and it won‚Äôt be my last. The tour included the unforgettable highlight of climbing Mount Rinjani, which is something I could never have contemplated without the support of a tour group. Overall, it was just the right combination of organized activities, and ‚Äúdowntime‚Äú to do as we pleased."
906,This is an excellent trip for someone who wants to have an active holiday. The program builds to Rinjani with activities then chills at Gili. Be aware that if you struggle with the temple you are unlikely to enjoy Rinjani! Great mixture of activities.
907,"Fantastic trip. I consider myself in decent shape and this was still in a challenge but doable. I had an amazing time, I highly recommend this trip to anyone active and looking to see Bali, Lombok and Gili Air"
908,"Excellent trip for active people. Read the itinerary! Climbing Mt Rinjani is by far the most difficult part of the trip. The leader (Andy) is fantastic,!"
909,This was one of the best trips I ever made! All the activities brought the group together and we had so much fun. The Rinjari is challenging for sure!!! The trip is perfectly organized and it is a good balance between activities and free time.
910,"First time travelling on an Intrepid group tour and couldn't recommend highly enough. The itinerary is well planned, with an interesting mix of adventure activities building to the Mt Rinjani hike and few recovery days on Gili Air. The hike is tough, but worth it, and a good pair of hiking boots made all the difference for my trip. Andy was an incredible trip leader - experienced, professional and enthusiastic. Definitely recommend this itinerary if you can't sit still on holiday and want to experience Bali/Lombok."
911,"Really enjoyed this trip. A great blend of activity, culture and relaxation. You do need to be reasonable fit to enjoy it to the full"
912,"My first group/solo holiday and I wouldn‚Äôt go with anyone else. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Andy our local guide was so knowledgable, caring and fun! The activities were great and very well organised."
913,"I cannot fault this trip, if you‚Äôre up for a challenge and to immerse yourself in Bali and Lombok. Andy was a truely brilliant group leader and the local guides are all so kind and welcoming in sharing their culture."
914,"My first group/solo holiday and I wouldn‚Äôt go with anyone else. Everything was perfect from start to finish. Andy our local guide was so knowledgable, caring and fun! The activities were great and very well organised."
915,This trip was breathtaking and I highly recommend it. It was a good mix of activities with time to relax. The physical activities were challenging but totally rewarding. Andy was an incredible group leader and he did everything to make the trip unforgettable.
916,"I give the Intrepid Bali, Lombok & Gili Islands: Hike, Bike, Raft and Snorkeling 5/5 stars. This 12 day of adventure was our first trip to Indonesia, and it gave us a wonderful, diverse sampling of all Bali and Lombok have to offer. Each day got better than the last‚Äî from rafting through the jungle and walking through rice fields to climbing watching the sunset from Mt. Rinjani and exploring the gem of Gili Air. We loved the tour (and our guide Andy) and hope to make it back to experience the magic of Bali/Lombok again someday!"
917,"This trip is a fantastic blend of culture and adrenaline! Andy was enthusiastic and encouraging. If you love physical activities and cultural teachings, book this now! Be prepared for a tough but rewarding Mt Rinjani trek."
918,"An awesome combination of activities in beautiful places with lovely people. Challenging, rewarding, inspiring and also relaxing ‚ù§Ô∏è"
919,"This was an excellent first Intrepid trip! Definitely set the bar high. Each day I was pleasantly surprised and amazed. It was quite physically demanding but we also had ample relaxation and free time. The accommodation and transport was excellent, and Andy was a fantastic group leader."
920,Active Indonesia is an incredible way to see the country while also keeping fit and having some incredible adventures
921,"Diverse and well organised trip. The hike to MtRinjani was challenging, but definitly worthy. Andy was the best tour guide, very enthusiastic and professional. Definitely recommend this trip is you like exercise and dynamics daysüëåüèº"
922,Happy to do this . Just email me if you want me to. Rather use computer than iPhone. Egarzarella@hotmail.com I have done 4 intrepid trips - and so proud of our Australian company!
923,"If you are wondering on whether or not to book the trip, do it! It was such an incredible experience being able to see a new country and learn about their culture while doing active excursions. Definitely a challenge at times but so worth it!"
924,Excellent trip overall. Ourctour group leader was very knowledgeable on the local customs and history. Was then supplemented by other local guides. Would recommend this trip if you‚Äôre interested in an active style holiday.
925,"The Bali Lombok bike hike raft tour is excellent for those who aren‚Äôt very good at sitting still for very long, need exercising but also like a bit of chilled down time . A great way to seamlessly see Bali and Lombok and sneak in a trip to the Gili Islands ."
926,"Intrepid delivered us the perfect family holiday (not always easy with a teenager in tow!) A mixture of adventure, immersion in local culture and a different experience every day. We loved every moment!"
927,"This trip is a fantastic way to experience parts of Indonesia that would be much harder or impossible to find, by yourself. Physically challenging, fun, and fascinating glimpses of local life. Ima is an awesome guide who removes any stresses and makes sure there‚Äôs plenty of fun at all stages!"
928,"When booking this trip I wanted a combination of active and cultural immersion, and this trip delivered. I was excited for all those experiences, but what really stood out were the friends I made in the group that I was able to share it with. This trip allows you to do things you would not be able to do alone. Our guide Ima went above and beyond to create an incredible experience! I could not have imagined a better trip."
929,I absolutely recommend this trip! It's a perfect balance between fun activities and relaxation. I will never forget the people I met.
930,"Excellent travel experience! You couldn't ask for a better trip with a great mix of adventure, relaxation and engagement with local communities. Ima was an amazing guide who made the trip really special."
931,"I had an amazing trip, well organised and managed. I would definitely recommend for anyone wanting a challenge as there were lots of exciting activities. Huge shoutout to Ima our group leader, she was the best! I hope to travel with Ima again on another intrepid trip."
932,I can't recommend this tour highly enough. Amazing activities and sights and a great amount of variety. We also had an exceptional tour leader.
933,"A great mix of activities, carefully choreographed to progress in difficulty to culminate in a tough but rewarding 1800m volcano ascent & camp on the crater rim. Our guide Andy was a delight, the weather perfect & the group was super fun."
934,"This trip was amazing. Although the sights and cultural experiences exceeded our expectations, the best part was the trip leader (Andy!) and the attention to logistical details. This was our first Intrepid trip and we plan to use them again. However, we‚Äôre afraid we‚Äôve already peaked with this trip!"
935,"This trip is totally recommended for people who love adventure and meeting new cultures. Bali, Lombok and Gili Air exceeded in all aspects my expectations. The way the trip was progressing was perfect and it was very well organized. Last but not least, our leader Andy was a super friendly and professional leader which adds more value to this trip."
936,"Perfect mix of active and adventurous meets relaxation, culture and beauty. This was the perfect trip to do it all and experience an incredible part of the world. Don‚Äôt miss this one!"
937,"Amazing trip full of fun times, laughter and unforgettable memories! Such a diverse range of activities each day to get the heart rate going, with a lovely amount of downtime too. Mount Rinjani was super tough but a real highlight! I also recommend the optional dive to see the US liberty shipwreck."
938,This is the perfect adventure holiday and a wonderful way to see so much of this amazing country. I very much enjoyed all of the activities but I suppose the highlight was climbing to the crater rim of Mount Rigani. I came home feeling so much better physically and spiritually.
939,The trip offers a wonderful experience into the culture of Bali and Lombok whilst activating you physically and nourishing your soul; all in the hands of a great tour leader in Andy
940,Really wonderful trip. A fun and physically challenging itinerary that's also well balanced with time to delve into the culture of Indonesia and some relaxation too. You'll also have the pleasure of a lovely guide named Andy.
941,Great trip and overall experience. You are well taken care of and feel safe all the time. Amazing activities allow you to dive into another culture and feel as if you entered another world.
942,"This trip was the best thing I ever done for myself. I recently went through a painful divorce so this was my way of rediscovering myself. Everything on this trip was everything I didn't know I needed. My self-esteem, self-beliefs, and overall mental health were at risk but after this trip, I found myself again. Thanks to Mt. Rinjani!"
943,"Wow! Trip of a lifetime, even more spectacular than the write up suggests! Seamlessly organised. Andy is a star. Take an underwater camera to get amazing photos snorkelling alongside sea turtles! Each accommodation had its own wow factor. Recommend a windbreaker jacket for the camping, very windy and exposed."
944,I had such a great time in Bali and Lombok. The included activities are excellent and our guide Andy was brilliant. The Mt Rinjani trek was very challenging but equally rewarding. Highly recommend this trip!
945,"This trip was the best thing I ever done for myself. I recently went through a painful divorce so this was my way of rediscovering myself. Everything on this trip was everything I didn't know I needed. My self-esteem, self-beliefs, and overall mental health were at risk but after this trip, I found myself again. Thanks to Mt. Rinjani!"
946,Our group leader Andy Swandi is a type of tour guide I hope to have on every trip I take from now on!! He made every activity enjoyable no matter how physically exhausting it may have been. The itinerary was well thought out with adequate resting periods. There was not a dull moment. Very well coordinated even with multiple location changes. It was one of the most memorable adventure I‚Äôve ever taken and I can‚Äôt wait to go on another with Intrepid.
947,What an experience.. never thought I‚Äôd feel this way about a holiday but have achieved so much and created great memories.. Andy our tour lead was first class and instrumental in making this happen
948,"I attended the Bali & Lombok: Hike, Bike And Raft trip. If you are considering it, come prepared to walk, hike, cycle, and raft with some of the best likeminded people you could ever meet. Also, ask for Andy to be your guide! He is amazing!!"
949,"Great tour, great itinerary. Great mix of active adventures and chill time. Tour guide ANDY was amazing, couldn‚Äôt have asked of a more approachable lovely man who gave us so much great information on Bali and Lombok. You should definitely do this!"
950,"This is the most amazing trip, with a fantastic guide. Andy expertly led our group cycling through verdant firsts to the ocean, to walking through paddy fields up to the heavenly temple - all leading up to an epic hike up Mount Rinjani to watch sunset and sunrise over the crater rim. Truly amazing. You do need to be relatively fit as the mountain trek in particular is challenging but worth every moment. Top tip - take. a bivy bag to keep warm inside your sleeping bag. Have fun - it‚Äôs absolutely fantastic!"
951,"First off, thank you to Andy, our trip leader who made this Bali experience so amazing. It's a fabulous and challenging trip, with fantastic local support at every stage. The Mt. Rinjani climb is breathtaking (literally), as is the sunset and sunrise at the top!"
952,"Trip if a lifetime. This was an experience, not a holiday. Fell in lovecwuth Vsli and the people."
953,Very well organized trip and a great way to experience some of the highlights of Bali and Lombok and combining it with great activities. Mount Rinjani was definitely a highlight of the trip
954,The trip was breath taking. Viewed so many beautiful places in such a short amount of time. Every activity was different and so much fun. The sceneries were beautiful and our group leader (Palguna) was extremely friendly and helped us with any questions we had.
955,"Bali Lombok and Gili trip was an amazing introduction to all that is Indonesia from the kind generous people to the beautiful beaches, incredible landscapes and hiking. This archipelago is a never ending dream for the active minded. It was well balanced w biking, hiking, rafting, snorkeling‚Ä¶ I will be back again. Until next time."
956,Amazing journey that I finally got to take after COVID. Loved the variety of adventure in such beautiful landscape!
957,"I have travelled with Intrepid several times. They have never failed to be accurate with their descriptions of the trip, and the guides have always been proffesional, efficient yet friendly. I highly recommend Intrepid."
958,"First time Intrepid traveller. Amazing, immersive and rewarding experience. The best way to see Bali and Lombok. The best way to travel anywhere!"
959,"This trip is a great way to see the less traveled parts of Bali, as well as Lombok. Mount Rinjani was the highlight of the trip, activity wise. But really the star was our tour guide Andy. He made the trip that extra something special."
960,"Excellent trip, well worth it. I‚Äôm not a particularly fit person so was a little worried when I agreed to go along with a friend to a 4/5 grade activity trip! However I managed all the activities absolutely fine. The volcano climb is hard, but certainly obtainable and definitely worth the view and experience of camping on a crater rim! (Pack that thermal jacket however, it does get a bit chilly!) Andy was a great guide, super efficient and friendly. It has been one of the best trips I‚Äôve been on, but also down to a great bunch of people who joined! Bali is beautiful, the views phenomenal, highly recommend."
961,This bali adventure trip was perfect. The right amount of physical activity and down time to recharge.
962,"This trip was a blast. A good mix of challenge and relaxation, a fun group, a great leader, and a beautiful part of the world."
963,"Amazing trip, well worth doing and super organised with the excellent tour guide Andy who could not be more helpful! The Rinjani climb was super tough but so worth it for views at the top. Loved the mountain biking too. Bali in general is pretty incredible and the accom was definitely exceeded expectations! Thank you :)"
964,"Amazing tour led by the incredible Andy, uniting 12 global adventurers! The Mt. Rinjani birthday cake surprise was a delightful touch. Perfect for active travelers craving a thrilling, immersive journey!"
965,"Excellent trip with a variety of activity that builds to the pinnacle of Mt Rinjani. Our tour leader Andy was an excellent ambassador for his country and Intrepid. For future travellers - no matter how tired you are after coming off Mt Rinjani, take the walk to the waterfalls, it's totally worth the effort and you will feel massively refreshed and reinvigorated! Fantastic group of people to travel with, so grateful to have had this experience."
966,"Exceptional value! Trip leader Andy was fantastic and did all he could to make this a great trip. Very active, make sure you are prepared for the physical aspects. Majority - excellent excursions."
967,"Just back from Bali, Lombok & Gili Air. An amazing trip with the best guide, Andy. Great activities and the best locations. A amazing experience shared with a fantastic group of fellow travellers. Thank you Andy for making this so special."
968,"This trip was the most amazing adventure! Every single activity was fantastic! Andy was an excellent leader who ensured everybody felt safe, happy and well-prepared for each activity. Climbing Mount Rinjani and camping on the crater's edge was a challenge and certainly the highlight of the trip! However, it is almost impossible to choose because everything we did; cycling through rice paddies, snorkelling with turtles and white water rafting, were awesome! The trip was enhanced by my fellow travellers and Andy. If you've never been on a group tour, or are looking for an active holiday of a life time then I would 100% recommend this trip to you. It was a phenomenal adventure!"
969,"This trip provides a great mix of physical challenges, culture and time to enjoy the beautiful islands. Andy did an exceptional job, knowledgeable, funny and always on hand. I enjoyed travelling with our lovely international group - camping on a volcano, swimming with turtles and sharing beautiful sunsets/rises. The trip was so well organised and an exciting mix of activities that just got even better each day. I would wholeheartedly recommend this trip if you're looking for a seamlessly planned, active way to explore Bali, Lombok and Gili Isle if you only have a short period of time available :)"
970,"Absolutely brilliant trip - stunning scenery, awesome activities and memories for a lifetime. Almost too many highlights to mention, but the views from the top of Mount Rinjani were unbelievable, and Andy was an incredible group leader who made the trip. Was also blessed with an amazing gang of fellow travellers, already miss you all! Definitely arrive with a decent level of fitness to get the most out of it, especially the Rinjani hike."
971,Had the BEST time ever!! Some activities were challenging but definitely rewarding! All amazingly organised by our leader Andy who couldn‚Äôt have done anymore for us all! Definitely recommend to anyone thinking of travelling to Bali/Lombok! Definitely an amazing way to see it all! üëèüòç
972,"We took our two teenage kids on this amazing adventure. There was never a dull moment from rafting to bike riding , trekking up mountains to snorkeling with turtles . All this while sampling beautiful foods , indulging in Balinese massages , knocking back cocktails and lazing on the beach . There was barely enough time for the blessing and meditation ceremony at a mountain top temple , the flying yoga and cultural and ecological education. Andy (our guide ) you‚Äôre a ‚Äúbloody legend ‚Äú mate."
973,"This was an amazing trip. The activities were very well organised. The trek up Mt Rinjani was quite difficult but well worth it and we were well looked after. Our leader, Nova, was excellent - helpful, knowledgable and always available to answer any queries or questions."
974,Amazing trip! It takes you off the beaten track and truly immerses you in the real Indonesia.
975,Highly recommend this trip! It was the perfect way to have new experiences and make friends- every day was a highlight! Our group leader Andy as well as the local guides were amazing!
976,"The trip was just amazing and I can highly recommend it. Everything was very well organised and the activities we did were really cool. Andy was an absolut fantastic group leader and did everything he could to make that trip unforgettable. I learned a lot about local culture, had great food and met some awesome people :)"
977,"This trip was everything I wanted it to be and more. It was a great mix of activities and time to relax. Be prepared, the activities are all physically challenging but absolutely breathtaking. Our leader Andy was also great, we were lucky to have him. Would highly recommend this trip!"
978,"This is a fantastic tour of Bali, Lombok and Gili Air. Don't be afraid to go as a solo traveller, everyone on the tour is friendly and like minded. The hiking to Mount Rinjani is probably the most physically demanding activity on the tour, but totally achievable and is all down hill on day 2 of the hike. I feel I've seen all the best bits of Bali on this tour and would recommend to anyone that wants an active holiday."
979,"Intrepid provided an organized, well priced, professional yet relaxed and well planned and balanced first group trip for me! Not too many over touristed moments on the tour and the medium group size was good! The highlight was our local guide Ima and many of the activities I wouldn‚Äôt have done on my own. I recommend Intrepid trips based on my experience!"
980,Adventurous itinerary with a good balance of sporting activities and cultural learnings!
981,"One of our best Intrepid holidays. This is a full on itinerary, where you have experiences of a lifetime ‚Äì camping on the top of a volcano (be warned very physical, but very much worth it), praying with Hindu monks at the top of a mountain, swimming with turtles‚Ä¶.. Our guide, Ima, was awesome and a great group of fellow travellers"
982,"This trip was an incredible experience, there was so much to see and do for the incredible price on what was offered for this tour. Ima our guide was such an amazing host. A once in a lifetime experience! A must do!"
983,"This trip was incredibly fun and life-changing for me. Each day's activities get a little more difficult until the 2 day Mt. Rinjani hike, which is very strenuous. I highly recommend training for this before the trip! I had an amazing group and leader, Ima, who made the experience all the more enjoyable. Highly recommend this tour if you want to learn about Bali and Lombok while also getting your blood pumping."
984,The trip is great and quite physical. The hike up and down the volcano was very tough and shouldn‚Äôt be taken lightly. Andy the trip leader was absolutely amazing and is a great leader and helps make the trip one never to forget!
985,"This trip was a perfect mix of physical challenge, cultural experiences and time to relax and enjoy the beautiful islands. Our trip leader, Andy was exceptional, always making us feel comfortable and making sure we enjoyed every part of the trip. I would recommend this to everyone, a beautiful country filled with friendly people and the perfect mix of travelling around and getting to relax on holiday."
986,"This was a fantastic trip! I enjoyed getting to experience many aspects of the Indonesian culture, climate and landscape while rafting, cycling, hiking and snorkeling. The tour guides were lovely and provided so much information. Stunning sites in a beautiful country."
987,"I loved my trip to Indonesia. Our group leader Andy did an excellent job and I enjoyed travelling with our international group. The nature was gorgeous. The mix of our activties (walkin throug rice paddies, cykling, snorkeling, rafting, climbing a vulcanoe) was perfect and rich in variety. I would definitely recommend to travel with Intrepid to Indonesia! =)"
988,Trip had an excellent mix of different activists which were set at a level which was challenging at some points but overall very enjoyable.
989,highly recommend this trip. although it looks tough everyone works at their own pace and our leader andy was always accommodating to everyone‚Äôs individual needs :)
990,This trip exceeded all my expectations! Andy was so passionate and made the tour so incredible!
991,"The trip was well organised with a perfect balance between group activities and free time - physical grading is accurate and the group leader was amazing: knowledgeable, funny and available for help at any time. If you don‚Äôt feel confident with one activity, don‚Äôt worry, the group leader is here to make sure you are safe. I felt in good hands since day 1 - also got quite lucky with a good group of extremely funny people"
992,I highly recommend Intrepid if you want an adventure
993,Review
994,This was a fantastic tour with like minded families that exposed our teens to a different side of Bali most people don't see and gave us all an insight into the local culture. Take the trip if you want to enlighten your family and bring you all closer together.
995,"This is truly a magical experience. From the activities , to the tour leader, to the places you‚Äôll visit. Our kids loved it , we all learnt so much, we made new friends , had fun and feel in love with Bali!"
996,We saw all the hidden beauty of Bali that you would not know exist when not on a Intredid tour. Our guide spoke the local language so helped in every way needed. We loved touring with other families- our children formed friendships and never complained being ‚Äòbored‚Äô! We thoroughly enjoyed it.
997,We enjoyed the balance of physical and cultural activities that were suitable for both teenagers and adults. Having the activities in the morning and time to enjoy the destination in the afternoons was great. The guide was excellent and knowledgeable.
998,Bali with Teenagers exceeded all of my expectations and goals
999,It was a great experience for the whole family. Everyone enjoyed all the activities and felt like they got a great holiday. Thank you
1000,This trip with teenagers was great fun. As the Nan I was catered for as well. A great family holiday
1001,A fantastic way to explore Bali with teenagers with a good mix of interesting tours and activities.
1002,i have really enjoyed this trip all the families and ima were really lovey and nice to spend a holiday with
1003,A s√∫per balance of activities and down time to suit families with teenagers. Hotels were great and people we met were all caring and committed to making our stay in Bali a happy one. I have learnt a lot and had a great trip.
1004,Wonderful trip to Bali with a brilliant mix of activities and downtime. Great hotels and a gem of a guide. Such a brilliant holiday. Thanks Intrepid.
1005,"We had a great time on this trip with our two teenage daughters. The trip was lead by Lena who was a fantastic guide, lots of local knowledge and experience and an excellent role model for our children. The activities on this trip are great fun, challenging and a brilliant opportunity to meet with members of the local communities. We especially enjoyed rafting, snorkelling and visiting and sharing meals and activities with local communities. This trip takes you to parts of Bali that are well away from the really touristy areas with a great combination of inland and costal Bali. I would recommend this trip to other families who are keen to see real Bali, have some memorable family experiences and meet some local people who are so kind, welcoming and really keen to share their Bali."
1006,"I have no hesitation to recommend intrepid travel to my friends and family. it is a wonderful way to see parts of the world., you may not have thought possible. Well planned and organised travel, with your safety as a priority. Also, I like the value placed upon environmental considerations."
1007,An amazing experience for my family. I feel so grateful to have had this introduction to Bali and to have experienced different parts of this beautiful island. Guide Wayan was excellent and made the trip.
1008,This trip was a wonderful experience for my family. I feel very grateful to have had this introduction to Bali and the beautiful experiences it offers. Wayan our guide exemplifies Balinese hospitality and kindness and really made the trip special.
1009,We had a great time on the trip. It was well set up to provide an interesting and stress free introduction to Bali.
1010,"Wayan is fantastic, he‚Äôs everything you would want your group leader to be and more! As a kid he made sure everything was fun and exciting, introduced us to some of the culture mannerisms, and curated a mini family between everyone. I don‚Äôt think I can come to Bali again without being with Wayan!"
1011,Wish I‚Äôd been on an Intrepid holiday years ago! Would thoroughly recommend.
1012,Fantastic trip with Intrepid to Bali. Amazing experiences. Lots of variety. Led by a top tour leader Guna. Wonderful opportunity to meet with others who share similar interests. So many great memories. Looking forward to our next trip.
1013,Bali with teenagers was AMAZING!!!! My daughter and I enjoyed every moment of the trip. The teens were kept active throughout the entire trip. I could not recommend this trip and our tour group leader Wayan more strongly. ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.
1014,I recommend this trip to parents with teens. It is a great opportunity to enjoy Bali in a group where all are entertained. I enjoyed the activities and the accommodations selected which included breakfast. Our guide was friendly and we felt safe and looked after.
1015,The Bali Family Holiday with Teenagers was a fantastic mix of adventure and downtime. The activities were exciting for the teens and the parents got to relax knowing everything was taken care of by our guide. I highly recommend the trip!
1016,My son and I loved all the activities and enjoyed hanging out with other families. Our tour guide was very helpful and made everything so easy for us to do. It was great having everything organised for us - white water rafting; biking and snorkeling.
1017,Wonderful trip with lovely people and a great way to see some of Bali. The whole family ( parents + 17y boy + 14y girl) loved it. Fantastic guide. Great range of activities. Lovely hotels.
1018,"Our trip was a once in a lifetime experience filled with many moments that created wonderful memories for our family. We loved that tour had the perfect mix of outdoor physical activities, cultural experiences, and relaxation. Our leader was incredible and made sure we all had a safe and enjoyable experience."
1019,The trip was very well designed and perfectly illustrated for the age group. As per normal with Intrepid the guides went above and beyond to make the trip educational and enjoyable. Would deffenintly recomend the tour and Intrepid.
1020,"The Bali family trip with teens was outstanding. Activities with local guides ranged from exploring coral reefs to basket weaving, and were all highly impactful. The accommodations and food were steeped in genuine local culture. The trip was enriching and rejuvenating."
1021,The Bali trip is amazing you meet so many new people so it's great for your social life but at the same time it's great for your mental health the actives were so fun would definitely be keen to do it again
1022,Fabulous active trip for teens. The activities were spot on. The e-bike and river rafting were beyond expectations. Our tour leader was knowledgeable and was great with kids.
1023,"I chose Intrepid because as a solo mum I wanted to take my two kids on an adventure, but I didn't want the stress of planning or executing. Our Bali tour with our group leader Tini was amazing - the kids didn't want it to finish! Every day had a highlight, we couldn't pick a favourite! Definitely a great adventure for the whole family."
1024,"We had a fantastic trip and I would recommend. Our 14 year old loved the e biking, rafting and snorkelling but also relaxing by the pool. You do learn about the culture/lifestyle in Bali but this was intertwined with the activities rather than museum and temple trips everyday which suited us."
1025,"This is a wonderfully adventurous trip for the whole family. See the countryside, rice fields and fishing villages. The whole family will love it!"
1026,This intrepid tour is amazing. 10/10 recommend. You do so much and see so much in such a little amount of time. Every activity has something for everyone. Definitely coming back here!
1027,We really enjoyed the Bali with teenagers trip! Our guide Guna was excellent. Itinerary includes visits to different areas of the island and activities were included every the days. Our teenagers had fun with the other kids and adults enjoyed each other company as well! I hope intrepid includes more destination for family with teens! We are looking forward to our next adventure.
1028,What an adventure we had in Bali - expertly guided by Maman. Such variety and excitement with plenty of time for a chill. Never seen boys move so fast when the snake swam across the river!! My favourite were the UNESCO protected paddy fields - a photo cannot communicate the beauty and scale - all from an E-mountain bike.
1029,"This was a great teenage family trip, with a good variety of activities for all the family. Bali is a really friendly island catering for all nationalities - especially when it comes to eating out too and there was plenty of choice for all the family."
1030,Excellent trip. I would highly recommend it. It‚Äôs great to see everything from the countryside to the beaches.
1031,Review
1032,"This is the Instagram tour, there's no substance to it, just a series of opportunities to take photographs between long days in the minibus."
1033,A very full and interesting trip with lots of variation suitable for all ages. Some long travel days but there were interesting stops along the way.
1034,"Yohanes, our group leader, helped us experience a great adventure during this trip. The best part of the trip was the last 2 days sailing, hiking, and snorkeling in komodo National Park. We were extremely lucky to see 6 komodo dragons, including a baby dragon. Go before the rest of the world finds out, and it gets crowded."
1035,"Fascinating, unique tropical island tour through unspoilt landscapes, with many local villages, rice terraces and waterfalls and full 2-day sailing in Komodo National Park the highlight. But compressed into 9 days means there is a lot of time spent in the bus as there is a lot of ground to cover. Suggest book pre-days in Moni / Kelimutu!"
1036,"Great trip to an island in Indonesia that will become much more touristy soon so go now! Good mix of overland, hiking, and on the water."
1037,"Incredible trip to explore part of Indonesia that is still developing for tourists, son many unique opportunities that you won‚Äôt find elsewhere."
1038,"This was a brilliant trip, seeing rural life throughout our journey across the island. Lots of unique experiences along the way. The 2 day boat trip was particularly amazing with so many activities to take part in over the 2 days. Our hike to the conical huts was sadly cancelled due to bad weather but our guide, Yan, created a brilliant alternative itinerary. We were looked after every step of the way and Yan, together with our bus driver Anus, was amazing at managing any eventualities! There are some long days of travel on some bumpy windy roads but the journeys are broken up by activities along the way. A really varied trip!"
1039,"What a delightful place Flores is. People are very friendly and welcoming. The scenery is spectacularly mountainous although more arid in the west. Be prepared for long days of travel on the comfortable bus, which due to the terrain, tends to travel at 30kph outside of towns. It is noticeably less tourist focused outside of Labuan Bajo. We have recommended additional time exploring village life. Some fascinating cultural experiences along the way and the overnight stay in the large, air-conditioned boat with spectacular snorkeling made for a great way to finish off the trip. Many thanks to our caring guide Yohanes, who was focused on making the most of our time together and sorted out all the logistics behind the scenes."
1040,"Yohanes was a great leader. Long days of driving steep, twisty and narrow roads were offset by the lovely time snorkeling from the boat. We had a very enthusiastic group of fellow travellers who made the trip extra special."
1041,"I had eight unforgettable days during the ""Komodo and Flores Adventure"" trip: our guide Yohanes, ten very enthusiastic travelers, the itinerary, and the weather were all in perfect harmony, as is fitting for Indonesia."
1042,"Komodo and Flores Adventure 12 May 2024. An excellent trip, lots of variety, highlights Wae Rebo overnight stay and the boat trip around Komodo Islands. Seeing the dragons up close in their own environment was just amazing. Our group got along really well and our leader Yohanes was excellent. He always had a smile and he would do his utmost to ensure we all had a truly memorable trip. Our driver driver Eamon was also excellent, handling any of the challenges of the road conditions with such skill. He was also very obliging helping with luggage and ensuring our safe boarding and exiting of the bus. He and Yohanes were an excellent team and censured everything ran smoothly."
1043,"A unique opportunity to see Komodo Dragons, and some of the most stunningly beautiful, unspoilt scenery I have ever had the privilege to visit. The Indonesian people were warm, welcoming and a joy to engage with."
