Zulla ·,Traveled April 2025,5.0 star rating,"Intrepid’s Beautiful Bali trip was the perfect intro to this magical island. From start to finish, everything felt so thoughtfully curated - from the peaceful home stay and delicious home-cooked meals to the incredible cultural experiences that took us off the beaten path (there’s so much more to Bali than the tourist traps). Walking through the rice fields with a local farmer while learning about Bali’s rich history was a highlight I’ll never forget. Our host and driver were absolutely amazing - warm, knowledgeable, and full of heart & joy for their beautiful land. I truly felt like I got to see the soul of Bali, not just the sights. It also made me fall in love with the island, its people, and its traditions. If you want to experience this magical place in an authentic and deeply meaningful way, this is the way to do it!",Review submitted 22 Apr 2025

These very enjoyable and exciting guided tours offer a decent standard of accommodation, food, transport and help you ""get into"" what makes a country tick. You have all the fun and learn about the local culture, participating to bring economic benefit to the communities. A good time is had by all, knocking spots off the alternative of ""lying on a beach""...you see, do and learn so much - all in a laid back and utterly enjoyable manner.

The trip was balance with alot of cutural experiences, lots of great activities, but with enough down time for yourself to go and explore the Bali streets, restaraunts and just time to soak in the Bali Island vibes. Our guild Andy, was excellent, knowledgeable, friendly and well organised. Which made our trip run smoothly and hassel free and relaxing. The accommodation was basic, but clean and very traditional, which added to the whole Bali old world feel that I remembered from 20 years ago.

Just be prepared to be on the road for 4-8 hours every other day, by train or bus, hotels comfort ok but minimal at times, noisy and jammed packed environments most times, super hot and humid weather, scared internet and out of comfort zone a lot.

The locals in Bali are such warm and friendly people and can't forget their food! Every meal was so fresh and delicious, they had many vegetarian options for myself and a couple others in our group. Again it was because of our leader, Wayan, that the trip so enjoyable. He was very kind, knowledgeable and always went out of his way to make sure the group was happy and safe (most importantly).

Additional activities such as the cooking class were also often overlooked due to time restrictions which made many of these options quite redundant as we rarely had time to do them.",Review submitted 29 May 2024

katie ·,Traveled September 2023,5.0 star rating,"This trip pushed me out of my comfort zone which is exactly what I needed. I have never laughed so much in my entire life and the group were so beautiful and supportive. Yan was the star! We all agreed the trip would have been very different if we had a different team leader. He was oozing positivity and was so well organised as well as skilled at making sure the trip went smoothly and we were all happy and felt included. I would highly recommend any trip he is the leader of, as an introvert I managed 9 days with a group of complete strangers many of whom I now call friends. I pushed myself to try new things and learn about a different culture and I feel like a new person with a far more positive outlook on life. Thank you so much Intrepid, i will definitely be booking again.",Review submitted 16 Sep 2023

Our guide, Mangun, was knowledgeable and organised and made for a stress free trip. Climbing Mt Batur was an absolute highlight and whilst not an easy hike to the top, it is well worth it. Equally the snorkelling trip was outstanding. Unfortunately the homestay element wasn't up to standard, this was an isolating experience that split the group up, which is unfortunate as the rest of the trip was excellent.

As my first-time solo travel trip, I was a little anxious at first, but being part of a group and being lead by a great tour guide made me feel completely at ease. It was a fantastic way of seeing many parts of Bali, a place where there is virtually no public transport, so being driven from place to place was great and having a guide made things really smooth. I was really impressed with the range of activities included, it felt like a lot was packed into the 8 days! I would definitely recommend this trip to any solo travellers.",Review submitted 13 Oct 2022

She had great knowledge of the local culture and customs. She was so happy all the time and had a great attitude towards life. We laughed a lot together as a group on this trip. The group we had was diverse and everyone got along so well. We became such good friends at the end of the trips. seriously an amazing bunch that I traveled with. On the last night of the trip, our guide took us to live music and we all had a blast dancing. The local guides at every location spoke fluent English and were very knowledgeable. Our snorkeling guide helped me learn free diving. The guides on the Batur trip (Wayan) helped me throughout the route get up onto the mountain with a bad knee and took us through the local farms going down. Really enjoyed the camaraderie and positive vibes. Balinese people lead simple yet happy life. I learned so much from their attitude towards life. Just an amazing trip.

It was awe-inspiring. I additionally had super experiences snorkelling in the Bali sea, taking part in a lovely spiritual ritual, walking around markets, browsing small shops in cities we stayed in, spending leisurely time on beaches, and connecting with a few of the awesome, like-minded people on the journey with me.

Nicola ·,Traveled August 2024,5.0 star rating,"I would highly recommend the Discover Lombok trip, it was exactly what I hoped it would be with a good mix of cultural experience, activities and relaxation. Accomodation is as expected 3-3+ Stars but the locations are 5 Star. Guna our trip leader was amazing! He was constantly feeding us with information and insights to Bali & Lombok culture and checking in with us all regularly to ensure we were happy, and encouraging us along the way to ensure that we got the most out of our trip. I was travelling alone and our group was a diverse bunch of people, we all got along great and it was sad to say good bye to my Lombok family at the end of the trip. If you are looking for a trip with a slower pace but cultural experience, this trip is perfect. This is my second Intrepid trip and it won’t be my last!",Review submitted 26 Aug 2024

I was beyond impressed every inch of the experience from the Group leader, the guides that helped us with all of the local activities to the accommodations and travel. One must be very open minded when being in a very different culture and environment to what one is used to. It is a daily reminder to be courteous and kind to others in your group and locals. This was a life time experience for me and I would love to have another one.

Highlights included seeing how the locals lived and worked in a weaving village and also the traditional Sasak community. Our guide Yan also generously invited us to break fast and have dinner with his family during Ramadan; which is an experience you could never achieve travelling on your own. Accommodation far exceeded my expectations and was actually very luxurious in parts. The only downfall was our tour group was small with two thirds already having travelled to Bali together so it was a bit hard to break into that dynamic and we didn’t get a welcome dinner to break ice as the first night was their farewell Bali dinner. I’d suggest an extra night in Sanur for the Bali tour so those leaving can say goodbye; then a fresh start for the new group the next night. It’s pretty disappointing to start your holiday without a welcome dinner. That aside; highly recommend this tour!",Review submitted 13 Apr 2023

Highlights were the snorkelling, rice fields and a local Lombok wedding. Would highly recommend this trip, thanks Abraham!",Review submitted 09 Jul 2022

I highly recommend this trip to anyone. I was a solo traveller who didnt know what to expect and i have learnt a lot about myself on this trip. Thank you so much interpid and Wayan for one of the best experiences.",Review submitted 28 May 2022
